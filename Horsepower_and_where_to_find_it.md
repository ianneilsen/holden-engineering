Horsepower (and where to find it)
How do we go about getting power from our engines? Novice builders might 
have a vague idea about "making things bigger", ie. bigger ports, 
bigger carbs, bigger cam, more compression and so on.
And while there is some truth in this - high performance engines do in fact have pretty much 
more of everything - I thought it might be useful to take a closer
look at how we go about making power. Hopefully a better understanding of the process will help us 
to achieve results that are close to our target.
It has often been said that an engine is nothing more than a glorified air pump, and that the 
more air we can make it pump the more power it will produce. This is fair enough but it doesn't 
even come close to telling the full story. Yes, we need to pump as much air as we can,
but we also want expend as little energy as is possible on pumping. 
As well as that we need to be aware that simple pumping can only fill a cylinder so far, and
that there are other ways of maximising the charge mass. Next, we want to burn the fuel/air charge as efficiently as possible.
Lets take a look at some of these processes now.
Airflow is probably the most fundamental requirement; without sufficient flow we have no hope of 
meeting even modest power targets. There are some handy
rules-of-thumb (eg. cfm x 1.5 = hp) to estimate the flow requirements but
these are an oversimplification and therefore of limited value. The trouble is that they are generally
based on a peak flow figure (which may or may not be at a lift point that is reached with the cam used)
and fail to account for the flow at all other lifts. It's possible therefore to make much more or less power than
the formula would indicate depending on the cam. A much better method is to use
time/area
or
time/flow
figures. By plotting the valve lift and flow for the cam profile against crankshaft
rotation throughout the cycle it will be possible to produce a flow curve that represents the actual air
available to a specific port/cam combo. The area under this
curve will give a very close approximation of the horsepower potential.
From a horsepower perspective then, it's obvious that the port and the cam profile are inextricably linked.
To predict the power output accurately you'll need accurate data for both the port and the lobe.
The next consideration is combustion efficiency. It is often largely ignored though this 
is understandable; it's often difficult to make major changes. But it's an important 
factor, just as important as raw flow in fact. Increase port flow by 20% and you'll pick up a 
similar increase in power. Increase combustion efficiency by 20% and again you'll have a similar 
power increase, with no loss of flexibility and a decrease in fuel consumption as a bonus.
Bottom line is this: if there is anything you can do to achieve fast, controlled and complete 
combustion you should do it. And if you don't think this stuff is important take a close look at some 
Jaguar V12 engines - you'll see how it's entirely possible to have both miserable fuel 
economy and a very modest power output thanks to poor combustion.
Now, if the goal is to make as much power as is possible for a balls-out racer then the plan is 
pretty clear - we just need to use as much port flow and area under
the lift curve as is physically possible (provided of course that the engine is strong enough for 
the resulting rpm range). But what if our application requires
us to trade off some peak power for a somewhat wider powerband? Should we reduce both the cam and the port?
Or just use a smaller cam? Or smaller port? With factory heads that decision 
is made for us already. It is practically impossible to be have "too much port" with a factory head.
With a 12 port head in particular, just go ahead and get as much flow 
as you can and use the cam to tailor the shape of the power curve. You physically can't make the 
ports too big.
Even with the 9 port heads, the primary focus should remain on maximising the port flow. With these heads 
you
can
make
the port area a bit too big but it's a fairly simple matter to determine when to stop grinding. With either head, 
the flow is ultimately limited by the valve size and location, and you'll eventually get to a point 
where the flow ceases to increase in line with port area enlargement. This point is where you want 
to be with the 9 port, but as mentioned
before you physically won't be able to make a 12 port intake too big. I probably should also 
mention that while the ports have some physical limitations the cam does as well.
We'll go into this in a bit more detail in the cam section but the 
important message here is to always maximise port flow as the first priority. The shape of the power
curve can then be tailored using the cam profile.
There are two advantages to using this approach. 
Firstly, a high-flow port with a short duration cam will have a wider
powerband than a mediocre port and big cam combo. And secondly, the good port/short cam combo will 
have slightly lower pumping losses than the alternative.
Let's assume now that we have the best possible port and the best possible cam in our engine. 
Cylinder filling should be pretty good at this point, and it's quite
likely that we have a VE of around 100%, at least at some engine speeds. It's entirely possible 
that you may meet your horsepower target without having to do
anything more than this. But where do we go from here if we want or need more (and I'm talking 
about N/A engines here)? This is where wave tuning comes into play; by effectively making use of 
finite pressure waves in the intake and exhaust tracts we can substantially increase cylinder fill 
to levels of well over 100%.
Before we get into wave tuning we probably should clear up a myth. Many magazine articles talk 
about things like "ram tuning", or a "column of gas", using high velocities to maximise "inertia 
assisted filling" and so on. These are interesting topics and we'll cover them in a bit more detail later 
but for now the only thing we need to know is that the net effect of any of these
charge weight 
x velocity
theories is negligible at best. At worst they are simply horseshit.
Finite pressure waves on the other hand, behave very similarly to sound waves and can provide 
very worthwhile gains. Ultimately, what we want is to have a high
amplitude positive pressure wave to be returned through the intake port and into the cylinder just 
before the intake valve closes. This is where the major gains
come from, but there are also gains to be made on the exhaust side, from returning a negative 
pressure wave to the chamber during the overlap period. How well do
these waves work? Without them it's very unlikely that an engine will pump any more than 100% of 
cylinder capacity even over a narrow rpm range. But with the help of finite-pressure waves it's not unheard of
to have VE's approaching 130%. Anything capable of these kinds of power increases on an 
already well developed engine is surely worth consideration. And this is where the pipework comes 
in...
The pipework or manifolding is the final part of the puzzle. We cover this in more detail later 
but we'll have a brief look at it now. The basic idea is to
use intake and exhaust pipes that are proportioned in such a way that
a,
they have sufficient flow 
capacity for the application and
b
, encourage the development of
pressure waves of sufficient amplitude and duration to provide the desired power increase. The 
cross-sectional area will be a tradeoff between maintaining sufficient flow rate and having enough 
velocity to be able to jerk a high-amplitude wave into existence. Lengthwise, we need to use a 
dimension that returns the working wave at just the right time. Additionally, it is an advantage to 
have an intake pipe or runner that is free from anything that will disrupt the wave action eg. venturis
or throttle valves. Manifold designs that use unthrottled runners with a plenum and an upstream throttle 
have a clear advantage here with regards to peak power.
Now, in the paragraphs above we first looked at maximising airflow and then later we covered the use of
finite pressure waves. In practice, we should also address both of these subjects in the same order of
priority. In other words we should first try to achieve the best possible flow from our engine, and only if
we have done this and our power target hasn't been met would we work to maximise pressure wave activity.
Why is this? Well, there is really no downside to good flow - we can extend the high rpm output quite
considerably without sacrificing low rpm power. Power gained from pipe tuning to optimize pressure wave
activity on the other hand can come at a high cost. While it's possible to realize significant gains
at certain rpm ranges - say 15 or 20% - at other rpms not only will the HP not be improved, it will actually be reduced
by a similar percentage (google "megaphonitis"). The torque curve will become peakier as the pressure wave activity is accentuated.
So unless you can keep the engine "on the pipe" or in the rpm range where the wave action is beneficial
the car is likely to be no faster or perhaps even slower than before. But if the maximum outright power is
the goal, and you have sufficient gear ratios available, then harnessing the finite pressure waves can provide
a very substantial boost to peak power. Riders of highly tuned two-stroke racing
bikes will be very familiar with the resulting power curve.
So there you have it, the bare bones of power production. Once you fill the 
cylinder effectively it's simply a matter of adding fuel and spark
to be well on the way to hitting your power target.
