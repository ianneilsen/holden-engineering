Camshafts and Valve Gear
This section is meant to give a broad overview of the cam
and valvetrain. More specific information related to choosing an
actual cam profile will follow in the next section.
The limitations of the Holden cylinder head have a big influence
over the cam profile selection. Because the port design and the
tendency for the valves to be shrouded limits the high-lift flow,
it's important to get the valves opened as quickly as possible. In
other words we need to get as much area under the curve as we can
without making the duration ridiculously long. The downside to
using such aggressive profiles is a reduction in cam lobe and
lifter durability, but really if you want to get the maximum
performance from the engine you don't really have much choice but
to smack the valves open and put up with the shorter cam life. Like
many GM engines, the Holden engine would benefit from a camshaft
with bigger journals and a bigger base circle diameter - with flat
tappets there are limits to the lift and valve acceleration rates
that are achievable. In this respect a roller type cam would have a
decided advantage, though I'm going to conveniently ignore them
here as being outside the scope of these basic notes. If you have
the time and money to use rollers though, it would certainly pay to
discuss them with a reputable cam grinder as they will provide not
only a higher peak power level but more area under the torque curve
as well.
Basically we are going to have to choose beween hydraulic or
solid flat-tappet cams. Common wisdom has it that any street driven
vehicle should run a hydraulic cam, but there are some very good
reasons to go with solids. Everyone knows solids aren't susceptible
to the lifter pump-up issues that hydraulics can sometimes suffer
from. But there is also a substantial performance advantage that
goes with solid lifter profiles. Hydraulic lifter cam profiles need
to have a short but gradual ramp just before the valve acceleration
starts in earnest. The same thing happens on the closing side. The
net effect is that, for a given duration at 0.050", a hydraulic cam
will hold the valves off the seat for longer than a solid lifter
cam will. These ramps are so gradual that no useful flow occurs,
but it's enough to bleed off cylinder pressure at lower speeds. By
contrast a solid lifter cam will leave the valve firmly on its seat
before slapping the tappet rudely. In other words, for a given peak
horsepower, a solid lifter cam will give a stronger low end and
midrange than a hydraulic cam. Or looked at in yet another way, for
a given low or midrange torque, a solid will give a better top
end. Yet another advantage of solids is they will tolerate marginally
low spring pressures that would allow hydraulics to pump up at the same
rpms.
Hydraulic lifter cams do have a couple of advantages though;
they are quiet and maintenance free, and if performance isn't the
primary consideration they could be a logical choice. They also
don't require adjustable rocker gear. The factory VK EFI cam is an
excellent hydraulic grind for a mild engine, but of course any of
the original cams will be very badly worn by now. Also keep in mind
that the cams in the later engines were set up retarded a few
degrees to help with emission control so if you use one you might
like to install it "straight up" for stronger bottom end torque. If
however performance is the priority, definitely go for the solids.
They have a reputation with some for needing constant adjustment,
but in reality once everything is bedded in they should rarely need
attention. Millions of engines are fitted with solid lifters as
standard and these often go for years between adjustments. Granted,
the stresses on a high revving Holden 6 valvetrain might warrant
more frequent setting, but a few times a year should be enough.
Besides, adjustment is much easier and quicker to do on the 6 than
say a V8, so it doesn't take long at all.
When comparing cam profiles between different manufacturers
check the duration at 0.050" only, the advertised duration figures
are too "rubbery" to be meaningful.
Some very very rough rules of thumb for cam selection:
Longer duration = more top end, less bottom end
More lift for a given duration = more area under the torque
curve
Closer lobe centres/more overlap = more bottom end and less on top
(but more overlap also makes for rougher light throttle running and
idling)
Wider lobe centres = better top end at the expense of low down
torque, better light throttle running and idling
Slightly retarded cam timing = more top end, less bottom
Slightly advanced = more bottom end, less on top
Did you notice the pattern there? Anything that results in the
intake valve closing later will move the torque peak up the RPM
scale, and vice-versa. Of the four valve events the intake closing
is by far the most critical - you can shift the other three around
a bit and it doesn't really make much difference to the power
curve, but as soon as you shift the intake valve closing point the
curve will also shift.
So what kind of number would you look for when choosing a cam?
There is more specific info in the next section, but for now here
are some very broad ballpark figures:
Mild daily driver, smooth enough for granny - 200 to 210deg @
0.050", 0.39" to 0.41" lift (hyd)
Slightly warmer, rough idle but still fairly civilised - 215 to
225deg @ 0.050", 0.4" to 0.44" lift
Hot barely streetable cam - 230 to 240deg @ 0.050", 0.44" to 0.48"
lift
Bigger again, maybe just barely streetable for occasional use by a
masochistic driver - 240 to 250deg @ 0.050", 0.490" to 0.5"
lift
Animal, dont even think about trying to use it on the street
-250+deg @ 0.050", 0.520" to 0.570" or more lift
You'll note that I didn't mention lobe centre angles here. We'll
cover that in more detail later, but I will mention that the LSA of
many off-the-shelf street 'n strip type cams is compromised in order
to preserve some manifold vacuum and idle quality. In many cases better
performance can be had from a narrower LSA though it will probably
require an electric vacuum pump (for brakes) and make for a rougher
idle.
The engine capacity also has some influence on cam selection; a
cam that is "big" in a 202 will behave even "bigger" in a 161. Or
put another way, a cam profile that produces peak torque at a
certain speed in a large engine will peak at a significantly higher
speed in a smaller engine. Bottom line: don't kill the bottom end
torque of a small engine by using too much duration. We mentioned
this briefly in the Planning section but it bears repeating: the
cam profile
must
be selected with the available gear ratios
in mind. It's very easy to overcam the engine in the pursuit of horsepower,
and while the dyno numbers might look impressive it may well be impossible
to keep the engine pulling hard on the track with less than six gears.
Do your sums carefully - it's very likely that you'll have to use
a relatively conservative cam to get the most performance from the
commonly used transmissions.
Twenty-five or so years ago, there was a trend towards cam profiles with
more aggressive lift rates, higher lifts and shorter durations. The idea was
that with these profiles high outputs could be maintained without narrowing
the powerband as dramatically as the traditional cams did. The cams were
marketed using terms such as "high-intensity" and "high-energy", and the
inference was that the shorter duration could be compensated for with
faster lift rates. Or, in other words it didn't really matter whether
the area under the curve came from lift or duration, the engine would
make power proportional to that area. Unfortunately it isn't that
simple, but there are some that persist with this line of thinking even
today.
To put it simply; to make peak torque at a particular rpm level requires
a certain amount of duration, and no amount of additional area under the curve
will drastically change this. Certainly, faster valve acceleration rates will
help fill the torque curve either side of the peak, but they won't help much at lower
rpms and may even hurt low-end torque. Anyway, what I'm getting at is that lift and
duration are definitely
not
interchangeable, and if it takes say 305deg of
duration to make the engine peak at a particular speed, well, that's what it takes.
When you're choosing how much lift to use it basically comes down to
a trade-off between performance on one side and durability and expense
on the other. For a regularly street driven car I'd probably limit
lift to about 0.5" in the interest of long component life. For
an unlimited competition engine the output will keep increasing with valve
lifts right up to 0.650" or more, but you'll need some pretty high
quality parts to run these lifts for any length of time. Roller cams
in particular (because of the heavy lifters and high acceleration rates)
require springs with very high rates and these need to be very high quality.
And if the spring rates are astronomical so are the prices... 
Valves, seats and guides also take a pounding with the high
lifts and spring rates. If that's what it takes to be competitive then
there isn't much you can do but run the big lifts, but be prepared to pay for it..
When you get the cam, make sure you get all the related
components from the same manufacturer so that you can be sure the
springs, retainers and lifters etc. are compatible. You may need to
make the spring seats bigger/deeper for big springs and high lifts.
If you aren't sure how much material is in the spring seat area do
a practice run on an old head first or cut an old head up to see
how much meat is in there. Be aware that the 12 port heads ran a shorter
installed height than the 9 port heads, and that often means that 0.1" offset
retainers are necessary even with some street cams. For more extreme cam
profiles it may pay to use longer valves (eg. V6 Buick valves) in order
to make room for longer springs. Beehive springs have some definite advantages
over traditional designs, especially for a competition engine. These springs are generally
most stable when run very close to coil bind at full lift.
Modern beehive springs wound from ovate section wire
easily outperform old-style springs of similar tension. They also use a smaller,
lighter retainer that eases rocker clearance problems with high lift cams.
Drive the cam with an alloy or steel gear, but for chrissakes
don't use those damn straight cut gears - their only virtue is
their cheapness and the constant whining is irritating. The claims
that the helical gears sap power are drivel. The only time I would
consider straight cut gears is on a very high rpm engine with
extreme valve spring pressures. These engines tend to have a fair
bit of torsional vibration of the camshaft and with helical gears
they can rattle badly against the thrust faces. In extreme cases they can break the retainer plate.
For anything not so radical (and for any streetable engine) I'd stick with helicals
though.
Don't try to be clever with cam timing; at least to start with
set it exactly where the cam grinder intended it to be run; you can
experiment with minor variations later. If you need to reposition
it more than a few degrees for best performance you've got the
wrong cam... Carry out all the usual precautions ie. check for coil
bind, retainer to guide clearance, valve to piston clearance,
rocker slot, etc etc. As well as all these checks, you'll also have
to check for valve to deck clearance because of the chamber
overhang. The press in rocker studs are good enough for a mild
engine, but use screw in studs for setups with higher lifts and
heavier springs.
The factory rocker setups are fine with any reasonably
streetable cam, though you'll need some form of adjustment for
solids. Roller rockers are nice to have with bigger cams, say over
0.42" lift, and the shaft mounted jobs eliminate stuffing about
with guideplates. If you run ball-mounted rockers (or stud mounted
rollers) on a head that originally had aluminium rocker bridges you
will need guideplates and hardened pushrods. Standard rockers are
1.5 ratio, the easiest way to increase the ratio is to use smallblock
Chev rockers. These generally bolt on with no modifications required.
I've also had success with big block Chev and Cleveland rockers. These
do require that the stud hole is slightly offset but seeing as the hole
generally needs to be drilled and tapped to 7/16" anyway it's not a big deal.
These slightly longer rockers have an advantage with very high lift
cams in that they have slightly less "sweep" across the valve as
well as providing additional clearance with oversize alloy retainers.
Of course, with modern beehive springs and their small-diameter retainers,
obtaining sufficient rocker to retainer clearance is no longer such a problem.
Be aware that higher ratios
increase the loading on the entire valvetrain so while they
definitely improve performance there is a tradeoff in durability. Also keep in
mind that while high rocker ratios increase the area under the entire curve
the effect is most pronounced during the overlap period. If the engine responds
well to more rocker but has signs of reversion or odd hollows in the torque
curve you may want to try a cam with slightly wider lobe centres but correspondingly
shorter duration.
If you decide to try the cheap Chinese rollers carry a couple of
spares in your toolbox, and pray that when they fail you catch them
before they dump a million needle rollers throughout your
engine.
Adjustable shaft-mount rockers like these Street Terra units allow
some flexibility when setting up the rocker geometry
There is a difference in the length of pushrods used with ball
mounted rockers versus the later non-adjustable rockers, so be
careful when mixing components from different engines. You should
also take the time to get the rocker geometry right; with so many
things like deck height, cylinder head dimensions, cam profile etc.
being altered it's quite likely that a non-standard pushrod length
will be required. At the mid-lift point, an imaginary line drawn
from the valve tip contact point through the centre of the rocker
pivot should be perpendicular to the valve stem. Shaft mounted
rockers have an advantage here as the pivot post can be machined or
shimmed to correct minor discrepancies.
Holden lifters should be used, even though there may be others
(eg. Chev) that will fit. The reason for this is that the other
lifters may not have the relieved section in the right position on
the body, and could possibly cause a major loss of oil
pressure.
Follow the manufacturers cam break in procedure closely and make
sure you use an oil with sufficient zinc additive to protect highly
loaded flat tappets, eg. Rimula Super or Valvoline Racing. Most
modern petrol engine oils aren't suitable, and using them will lead
to cam and lifter failure.
Keep in mind that many of these cams will provide insufficient
vacuum for brake boosters and so on - you may need to provide a
separate vacuum source such as an electric pump or an alternator
from a Japanese diesel with a built-in vacuum pump.
One more rule-of-thumb: if you can't choose between two
different cams always go for the milder one. An overcammed street
motor will be slower than it should be, and more painful to live
with.
