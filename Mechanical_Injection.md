Mechanical Injection Systems
Back in the heyday of the Holden six mechanical injection
systems were often fitted, mainly for speedway or drag engines.
Probably the most commonly used was the Australian-developed McGee
system, though other manufacturers components can be used as well.
These systems can (and have) been used on the street though it's
not recommended for reasons we'll cover later. They have the
advantages of simplicity and ruggedness, and are not affected by G
forces, unlike carbs. Performance wise, they are unlikely to show
much if any advantage over a well-developed carb system, though it
might be easier to use appropriately sized intake runners with
injection.
They basically consist of a vane type pump driven from the
engine, a barrel valve linked to the throttle butterflies and a set
of injector nozzles. The pump flow is in direct proportion to the
engine revs, and the barrel valve directs excess flow to the tank
depending on throttle position. Full throttle mixture is set by the
size of a by-pass "pill" or jet that meters return flow from the
nozzle manifold block back to tank. Because the engine will usually
require less fuel either side of the torque peak it is usual to use
additional bypass jets for both idle/low speeds and high speeds.
These are constant flow systems, with all the nozzles being plumbed
back to a common manifold block.
Nozzle size should be the smallest that can be used while
keeping full-throttle/high-speed fuel pressure within reasonable
limits. Mixture quality at medium to high speeds should be fairly
good, but at idle and lower speeds the nozzles will be dripping and
dribbling rather than spraying. For this reason much of the fuel
will pass through the engine unburnt at low speeds. To maintain a
burnable A/F ratio then much more fuel will have to be injected than
should normally be required. The engine may run cleanly enough but
it's quite likely that excess fuel will be washing the cylinder
walls at low speeds and this is the main reason to avoid using
these systems on the street. Fuel economy is also likely to be very
bad on a street engine.
For a competition engine - especially on methanol - mechanical
injection can give good response and power output while being
simple, rugged and virtually immune to acceleration, braking and
cornering forces. For precise metering over a very wide range of
speeds and loads however, EFI or a carburettor is usually a better
choice. J.Zed (see links section) can supply complete mechanical systems
to fit the J.Zed head or Sonic Injection can supply throttle bodies/manifolds
to suit the 9 port Holden head.
