Spec tips

* The cheapest option by far will be to scrounge around for a good 202 block.
The 202 pistons are shorter than the 186 ones so won't work with the 186 crank, even though the bore size is the same. And the 186 cranks have a smaller main journal diameter so the 202 crank won't just drop into your 186 block without a lot of machining. Rods, cams etc. are interchangeable. If you can find a 202 that hasn't been excessively overbored (most you come across these days are already +0.060") you can just swap over all the good bits from your old motor. A blue or black would be nice because they came with Starfire rods (if your old motor doesn't already have them) but keep in mind that if you use a later block then technically you'd be required to use the corresponding emissions controls.

* The deck heights are all the same; it's the type of rocker gear that determines what length pushrods to use. Late rockers with the aluminium bridge use a different length to the old ball-pivot rockers. If you use studmount rockers on a head that didn't originally have them though you'll also need guideplates.

* (One cubic inch equals about 16.39cc)

CR=(D + V + DC + G + CC) / (V +DC + G + CC)

CR = Compression Ratio

D = Displacement of one cylinder

V = Piston Volume (will be a negative value with a domed piston)

DC = Deck Clearance Volume

G = Gasket Volume

CC = Combustion Chamber Volume
