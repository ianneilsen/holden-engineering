How To Build A High-Performance Holden Six

Addenda - Tips for
				Beginners
Welcome to the addenda, the bit at the end where I stick all
				the bits that don't fit anywhere else. To kick it off here are a
				few general tips for beginners. Over the years I've noticed
				people tend to make the same mistakes over and over again - and
				don't worry, I've done my share of dumb shit too. So here is a
				short list of things to watch out for. As already noted it's
				aimed at the beginner but the experienced guys might find it
				entertaining and recognize a thing or two that might have tripped
				them up in the early days.
Don't Do or Change Anything
					Unnecessarily
- life is too
					short to be wasting time on trivial issues. Don't try to solve
					non-existent problems.
Don't Assume that the Factory
					Engineers Are Idiots
- and that you know better than them. They
					aren't, and you don't.
Beware the Law of Unintended
					Consequences
- it's quite likely that your solution to Problem
a
just created Problems
x,y
and
z
. This is all the
					more likely if the original problem was trivial anyway.
Don't Do Things to an
					Unnecessary Degree
- your engine wont care if there is a cc or
					two difference between chamber or port volumes, or if the
					rotating assembly is or isn't balanced to within a 1/4 gram.
					Obsessive compulsive disorder doesn't make power, the right
					parts combination, well machined, well built and well tuned
					makes power.
Don't Assume that Aftermarket
					Parts are Always Better
than factory parts. Sometimes they
					aren't. Sometimes they aren't any good for anything. Always
					remember that the primary function of any aftermarket part is to
					earn money for its maker.
The Engine Doesn't Care
how
					much money you have spent on it. Just blown 15 grand on a 202?
					Doesn't necessarily mean it's going to make power or not break.
The Engine Doesn't Care
how
					many hours you've spent on it. Just because you've spent 200
					hours on porting doesn't necessarily mean it's going to make
					power.
Structural Integrity is
					Everything
- a 400hp 202 ceases to be useful .0002 seconds
					after a rod bolt has broken.
Beware of General Consensus
-
					just because 10 different people told you to do X doesn't make
					it right. Mostly they're just repeating baseless things they've
					heard anyway.
When In Doubt Refer to the
					Laws of Physics
- not the drunk at the pub that had a 200mph HR
					back in '76. Everything that happens in an engine is subject to
					the laws of physics, everything can be calculated, confirmed or
					debunked.
Always Do Your Sums
- if it
					doesn't work out with a pencil and calculator then it's not
					gonna work on the dyno either. Guesswork is for amateurs.
Don't Keep Building Your Dad's
					(or grandads) Engines
- Dad might get all teary when he tells
					you about the 186 with the two barrel Holley he had when he was
					19. Truth is it was a piece of shit then and if you build it now
					it will still be a piece of shit.
Learn How To Tune
- a well
					tuned but mediocre engine will beat a poorly tuned engine with
					potentially more performance. Potential horsepowers aren't worth
					the paper they're written on. This is critically important, but
					also keep in mind Tip #4; you don't have to break out the jet
					box every time a cloud passes over.
Keep Your Streetcar Quiet
-
					enthusiasts might like the sound of a loud, healthy engine, but
					to everyone else you just look like a dickhead. Keep it quiet,
					have fun and stay under the radar. And don't get me started on
					those cock-smokers with their straight-piped Harleys...
Dont Believe in Magic
- some
					people would associate something special with high performance
					engine development - romance, magic, art (as in the "black art"
					of ...) whatever. It's all horseshit of course. Horsepower is
					nothing more than plain old physics and mathematics.
Prioritis
e - pick the
					low-hanging fruit first and apply effort where it's needed most.
					Don't sweat over carburetors if the inlet port only does 110cfm.
I Wish this Wasn't True
but it
					is - there are a lot of "tools" amongst the car
					enthusiast community. More than in the general public at large, I suspect.
					Never take advice from a tool and avoid
					them where possible. The corollary to this is that there are the
					nicest, most knowledgeable people here as well. These generally
					make a lot less noise than the tools.
Feedback is Importan
t - most
					experienced engine guys have a mental database containing
					everything they know of that does or doesn't work on a variety
					of engines. Every time you ask someone's advice, whether in
					person, by phone, email or web forum, take the time to reply
					with the results of that advice. The feedback is valuable and
					adds to the database. Build your own mental database.
Attempts to Do Things Cheaply
almost always turn out to save no money. And usually they take
					much much longer. I'm still proving this theory nearly every
					day.
Don't Invest Too Much Time
or money or
					"trick of the month" stuff in your first couple of
					engines. Make them cheap and basic builds that let you learn the
					fundamentals of building and tuning reliable, leak-free engines.
					Once you've got this down pat you can start on the 10,000rpm
					racers.
The One True Speed Secret
- to quote one of the great
					technical writers, the late Gordon Jennings: "There is only
					one Speed Secret: know what you are doing and do it thoroughly... the
					rest is mere mathematics, surgery and wrench twirling."
