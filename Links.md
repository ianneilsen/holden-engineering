How To Build A High-Performance Holden Six
Building the hot holden six

Links
A few links to suppliers and other sites of interest. Note that I don't have any business connections with any of these suppliers, and don't
necessarily use or endorse any of them in particular. Having said that, given enough coke and hookers I can be bribed to write all the right things....
Australian Specialty Racecraft
make some very nice street and competition oil pans for the Holden six.
Sonic Injection
are builders of very high quality EFI manifolds and throttle bodies, as well as main cap girdles and other parts.
Aussiespeed
make and supply a wide variety of manifolds and other parts, and are now producing the Cullen Ultraflow
manifolds that are highly regarded by speedway racers.
PipeMax
is an extremely useful software package, mainly for calculating header dimensions but has many other functions as well. Based on Blairs' proven formulae, it's very good value for money.
Engine Analyzer
is just one of the racing-related software packages made by Performance Trends. It's an easy to use engine design program that lets you run theoretical dyno tests to compare different engine combinations.
Ignitech
make ignition-only and ignition/injection controllers (ECUs). Originally designed for
bike engines but ideal for distributor-less Holden six competition engines as well.
J.Zed Heads
are famous in the straight six world, and there is probably nothing that you can do
to a Holden six that will give the same performance increase. As well as heads, J.Zed can supply mechanical injection setups, manifolds and other Holden
six parts.
This online
static and dynamic compression ratio calculator
is a useful design tool.
So there you have it, I hope
you have found something useful here. If you have comments,
corrections or suggestions I'd love to hear from you - send them to
snarlyjohn@gmail.com
. If
there is enough interest in this page I might even pretty it up
with some more pictures.. And as I said in the introduction, I
don't pretend that it's 100% complete or accurate, but with your
help we can get it close...
