The Parts Selection Process
Building an engine shouldn't be an adventure. By that, I mean that
when it's finished there should be no surprises. Your engine should produce
very close to the output you intended it to produce, and there should be no other
other nasty surprises such as excessive blowby or parts breakages. Provided
you plan your engine properly, select the right components and machine and assemble
them correctly then you should get the desired results without a lot of
post-assembly work. Even those pushing the boundaries with previously untested
combos should have a very good idea of what to expect when the engine is finished
and tested.
You wouldn't select random ingredients from your cupboard then bake them up
and expect a perfect sponge cake every time, but it seems plenty of engines are built
using only the vaguest of recipes or ingredient lists. 
Planning the build and selecting the right parts isn't difficult, but it's
staggering how often it's mucked up badly. Read through some web forums and again
and again you'll come across tales of people who have spent thousands of dollars
for mediocre results. Sometimes these engines have been "professionally" built,
but still they fail to produce the intended output, they shake flywheels or balancers off,
they may leak or dribble into catch cans or they just plain break. Provided
your HP target and budget is realistic all this expense and heartbreak is avoidable.
Here then is a very broad outline of the parts selection process for a naturally-aspirated
engine. We'll assume that you have already worked out how much power you need to be competitive,
and that it's possible to keep the proposed engine within its powerband using the available
gear ratios. A good simulation program such as PipeMax is an extremely helpful tool at this stage.
The first step is to estimate the required intake port flow. The rule-of-thumb for a six cylinder
engine is that the required flow rate (cfm@28") will be roughly 70% of the peak HP. In
other words if you need to make 250hp, you'll be looking for somewhere around 175cfm of flow at
28". This isn't a hard and fast rule - more flow than this will let you reach your goal with less
camshaft and less flow will need more cam. Just remember that a port with a lot of excess flow
may actually be counterproductive if the port is too big to provide the required velocity. This condition
is not very likely with the Holden six though, and virtually impossible to reach with a 12 port.
Now that we have a port picked out we can look at the cam profile and rocker ratio. These will be influenced
greatly by the flow characteristics of the head as well as the HP target. The intake/exhaust
balance of the head will also influence cam design but having said that I don't believe that measured
exhaust port flow rates have much relevance to an actual engine. An "aggressive" intake lobe will help
power output but on the exhaust side use a gentler profile with moderate lift and 5 or so degrees more
duration than the intake. Test your choices with a good simulation package. By this stage
you should have a closer idea of what the engines rev range will be.
From the previous step we now know what the intake-closing number will be, so we'll use that to determine the static
compression ratio we need to build into the engine. This is a simple calculation based on a dynamic
CR that suits the fuel and the intake-closing figure. Once you have the static CR you can go ahead
and select a piston/rod/chamber combination to produce that CR. Again we may have a number of possible
combos that will work and if so then combustion efficiency should be the deciding factor.
The first two steps gave us a very close indication of the output and the peak torque rpm that
we can expect. Using this information we can now choose intake and exhaust runner dimensions that
will work at this speed, and with the required flow capacity. Put simply the tube or runner length
will be determined by the torque speed, while the diameters are determined by the engines output.
This is where packages like PipeMax are invaluable.
Next we look at the carb or injection selection, again taking into account manifold design (eg. IR or plenum) as well
as the desired output and peak torque rpms. As a very rough rule-of-thumb you could use a carb capacity of roughly
1.25 x the port capacity for IR manifolds, or roughly three times the port flow rate for single
carbs on plenum manifolds. Both these are estimated using port flow at 28" water and carb flow at 1.5"hg.
At this point the power production part is basically done, but we also need to look at what might be called structural issues.
In other words what parts do we need to use to ensure the engine survives for long enough to meet our needs.
Questions we need to ask are:
What piston and rod designs and materials will be sufficiently strong enough to meet our goals? It's
obviously pointless to build an 8000rpm engine if the rod bolts are doubtful over 6500.. but it's just as silly to
spend thousands on forged pistons and rods for a mild 200hp street engine.
Can we get a block that will provide the required bore size, and with sufficient wall thickness to maintain
round bores under load? This is a problem area particularly with 186s and 202s as evidenced by the number of
these engines that dribble and fume into glorified buckets. If you can't maintain a good ring seal then you
really don't have an engine, and it may be worth considering a smaller bore with a higher rpm torque peak instead.
Will the engine be running at a speed that puts the crankshaft in a bad vibration period? This is a hard one
to calculate and you'll probably end up using a lot of empirical and anecdotal data to choose a flywheel/crankshaft/balancer
combination.
Lubrication - what do we need to do to ensure a reliably constant oil supply. It's no use making 300hp if we
burn all the bearings at the first corner. Conversely, a simple wet sump is often sufficient for many applications.
If you can answer these questions sensibly then you're already well on the way to avoiding being yet another forum tragic.
The right parts, machined correctly and assembled correctly will be a good start and provided the engine
is then properly tuned and broken-in you are almost guaranteed of success. Get even one component wrong though
and you are likely to be disappointed.
