How To Build A High-Performance Holden Six

Downdraft Common Plenum Setups
For the best performance, I tend to think one of the sidedraft
setups are the way to go, though I guess if you were trying to keep
an engine looking reasonably stock or you just want to keep it
simple a downdraft setup might fit the bill. For mild daily drivers
the Weber from the 3.3l XE Falcon works very well with a 12 port
head and stock manifold, though it's a bit small for very high
performance work. Even the stock Varajet flows more than a 350
Holley, and can make reasonable power but the downside is that
there are few people familiar with these carbs, and jets and rods
aren't as readily available as they are for other carbs. If you're
willing to spend some time with them though, they can work
well.
For higher outputs, some people have had good results with a
small 4 barrel carb on a 9 port motor, but whatever you do steer
clear of the 350cfm (or 500cfm) two-barrel Holleys on aftermarket
manifolding. A Holden 6 with
a well sorted Holley 350 will start and idle well, run cleanly and
produce a moderate amount of power. But it will also use more fuel
than the other small two-barrels, without any power advantage. They
obviously have a pretty severe problem with mixture quality and/or
distribution. I suspect that this is due more to the orientation of
the carb rather than any problem with the carb itself - a
peculiarity they have compared to the other 2 barrels is the
butterflies open together, and they swing open on an axis that's at
right angles to the engine. Maybe this contributes to the poor
distribution, and it would be interesting to try one rotated 90
degrees on a four barrel manifold. I know there are a squillion
blokes out there with Holley equipped sixes, and they all swear
that their engines run just fine. Which they do of course, but I'd
bet good money that they would make significantly more power and
use less fuel with a different carb.
There is however at least one manifold that
can
be made to work
with a two barrel Holley. The factory Varajet manifold can be modified
to give reasonable flow and good fuel distribution. We'll take a closer
look at the modifications in the next section.
While we're on the subject of Holleys, be aware that the two
barrel carbs are rated at twice the pressure drop of the four
barrels (3"hg versus 1.5"hg), so the 350 (and even the 500) two
barrel will be undersized on anything but a fairly mild motor.
Although downdrafts mightn't be the ultimate in performance, a
decent two-barrel on a stock 12 port manifold is a cheap and simple
solution for a mild street engine. For higher performance a four
barrel will provide sufficient bulk flow for good peak power but it
will be difficult to match the mixture quality and distribution of
a set of triples. Good results have been had from 390 and 465cfm
Holley 4 barrels, and for a full-on drag engine it might be
possible to use anything up to a 600cfm carb.
Various throttle bores compared. Clockwise from
top: Stromberg single throat from red 202, Rochester Varajet from
black 202, Weber from XE Falcon, 350 Holley. Varajet flows a bit
more than 350, the Weber just a tad less.
