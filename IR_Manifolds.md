IR Manifolds
With these systems, each cylinder has it's own individual
manifold runner and carburetor/injector butterfly. If you've had
anything to do with multi-cylinder motorcycle engines you'll be
familiar with these setups, they are like individual single
cylinder engines on a common crankshaft. There are obvious
advantages with regard to maintaining uniform mixture distribution,
and its also easy to make all the runners the same length. Often
it's also possible to make the runners relatively straight as well,
and this helps reduce fuel separation.
One peculiarity of these systems is the "quick-gulp" intake
characteristic - because each carb supplies only one cylinder there
will be a period of roughly 270deg where the flow into the cylinder
occurs followed by roughly 450deg of little or no flow before the
next inlet stroke starts. And because the carbs are flowing only
part of the time we need to use a total throat area of roughly
three times that of a conventional system. This explains why these
types of engines require carbs that at first glance appear to be
way too big.
The exceptionally clean flow of the Mikuni HSR helps to maintain both flow and velocity.
Examples of IR manifolding include the traditional triple SU and Weber
setups. Even though the 9 port heads have siamese ports the crank
layout and firing order dictate that essentially only one valve in
each port is open at a time, so in effect they run as an IR
manifold. The 12 port motors are particularly well suited to IR
manifolds as it's possible to use longish runners with a fairly
constant cross section all the way from the carb to the valve. This
can result in a useful boost to midrange power.
The triple Weber manifolds for the 9 port motors are a bit of a
weird one - basically we have two carb throats and runners joining
into a common port at the head face. In effect it's like two carb
throats feeding each single cylinder. I know some people have had
good results from these, but it hardly looks the most efficient way
to do it, and I'd be careful to keep the venturi size down if I was
using one of these manifolds. Old timers may remember one of the
HDT Toranas at Bathurst, where the rules specified that the number
of carb throats couldn't exceed the number originally fitted. This
particular car had two huge DCOE Webers fitted - one throat had
been blanked off while the other three fed the three siamese ports
of the 9 port head. To me this is a more logical way of feeding a 9
port than using triple two-barrel Webers. If you intend to run DCOEs
or Dell'Ortos on a high-rpm engine keep an eye on manifold runner length.
Most off-the-shelf manifolds have quite long runners.
Be careful with sizing when using individual runners on a 12 port engine.
If you try to use what's known to work on a 9 port with a 12 port you'll
find yourself seriously undercarbureted. The twelve port engine will need
a venturi diameter of around 40mm to reach its potential and the runners
will also have to be similarly bigger in cross sectional area than what's effective on a nine-port.
The Weber (or Dell'Orto) carbs have for a very long time been considered
the ultimate in Holden six carburetion (apart from the ocassional use of Amals),
but I feel that there are now much better systems available.
Modern flat-slide carbs such as Mikuni's HSR
series are aerodynamically much slicker, and flow extremely well while
maintaining a high velocity. Originally designed as a performance carb
for Harley Davidsons, they cope very well with the severe pulsing of an
individual runner layout. Six of these on a 12 port head will perform
exceptionally well, while three on a 9 port head will provide a much cleaner
flow path than the usual DCOE on each port. A further advantage is that
almost any length runner is possible with the Mikunis, whereas with the Webers
it may be difficult to get suitably short runners on a high revving engine, at least
without having fairly severe kinks in the runners. If you decide to try these
be careful with the sizing - a 45mm (for example) HSR will flow much more than a
similarly sized throat on a DCOE.
To summarise, IR setups generally give very good results, but
are more expensive and require a bit more work to synchronise the
butterflies and tune properly.
This Nissan engine has four Mikuni HSR carbs fitted to an IR manifold.
Probably the best currently available carburetion.
