Balancing
It seems like nearly everyone has an opinion on engine balancing
and the ideal balance factor. Search the internet forums for
"engine balancing" and you'll soon be wading through thousands of
posts. Unfortunately most of them will contain nothing but
misinformed opinions, hearsay, old wives tales and plain old BS.
Pretty typical misinformation levels for car forums come to think
of it. For what they're worth here are my opinions...
Depending on the application, balancing can be either a
non-issue or it could be of supreme importance. Mild street engines
with a rev ceiling of not much more than say 5000 - 5500rpm will
survive quite nicely without any particular attention, and with
either a counterbalanced or non-counterbalanced crank. Providing
the piston and rod weights are reasonably matched I wouldn't bother
with balancing at all. If it makes you feel better though, go ahead
and balance it.
As the rev range rises though, it becomes more and more
important to both use a counterweighted crank and to have the
entire rotating assembly balanced. Once you get into the speed
ranges of 6500rpm and above, it becomes critical to use the
lightest possible rods and pistons along with a fully
counterbalanced crank in order to avoid breaking blocks.
Before we go any further we might just take a look at how the
rotating and reciprocating masses act within a multi cylinder
inline engine. As usual this'll be a grossly oversimplified
explanation but hopefully it will help. Picture a typical inline
four (it's simpler than a six but the same principles apply). It
will have a single plane crank, where pistons 1 and 4 rise and fall
together, as do 2 and 3 which are 180 degrees from the end
cylinders. Ignoring the rotating masses for a minute imagine
pistons 1 and 4 approaching TDC - by the way the crank on our
engine has no counterweights whatsoever. As they are slowed down
they pull up on the rods and this force is transmitted through the
crank to the block. Now, if there were no counteracting force
applied these two pistons would be jerking the engine up and down
every time they pass through top or bottom dead centre. Riders of
old Triumph and Norton twins will understand this intimately. The
thing is though, as 1 and 4 approach TDC pistons 2 and 3 will be
slowing as well as they approach the opposite dead centre,
providing a countering downward force that exactly cancels out the
force from the other two cylinders. Similarly, if we now look at
the rotating masses (crankpins, rod big ends etc.) we see that they
also balance each other out (being 180 deg apart) without needing
any counterweights on the crank at all. The Holden six has a
similar inherent balance, and so runs more or less free of
vibration even without counterweighting - and even if it does have
counterweights the vibration level won't change much regardless of
the balance factor used. (In practice, the Holden six can buzz quite
badly at high revs. But this is mainly due to torsional vibration
of the crankshaft, a different kettle of fish altogether and mainly unrelated
to balancing).
Okay then, if vibration isn't a problem why is it so important
to run a counterbalanced crank on our sixes? Let's go back to our
four cylinder engine for a minute. Imagine the crank is spinning at
say 8000rpm, and pistons 1 and 4 are being slowed down as they
approach the top of their stroke. Lets say each of these pistons is
applying a force equivalent to about 2000kg, and likewise pistons 2
and 3 are each applying the same force downwards. Obviously the
forces will cancel each other out and there will be no tendency to
vibrate. But look at
where
the forces are applied. In effect
we have a force equivalent to 2 tonnes applied upwards at each end
of the block, while another 4 tonnes is applied downwards to the
centre. In other words we are expecting the block to act as a beam
as we apply pretty severe bending loads to it. Imagine supporting
the block at each end and pushing down on the middle with a
hydraulic press, then releasing the weight before rolling it over
and repeating the procedure. Now imagine doing this 16000 times a
minute. Looked at in this way it's pretty easy to see why the
Holden blocks tend to disintegrate when subjected to high speeds
with a non-counterweighted crank. Remember too that these huge
loads make their way to the block through the crank and the
bearings, so these too are stressed considerably.
It's pretty obvious that if we fit counterweights to each crank
web we can provide a counteracting force for each cylinder that
acts on the individual cylinders axis, and thereby eliminating the
bending loads on the crank and block. If we use a balance factor of
100% - ie. a counterweight equivalent to all of the rotating mass
as well as all of the reciprocating mass - then the loads on the
main journals and block can be completely relieved at top and
bottom centres. This introduces another problem though. At mid
stroke the counterweights will be applying lateral forces at
opposing locations to the block, so we still have bending forces at
work. The solution is to compromise by using a balance factor of
around 50% instead - ie. a counterweight equivalent to all of the
rotating mass plus half of the reciprocating mass. This way we
reduce the loads at top and bottom centres by about half, while
introducing lateral loads at mid stroke that are of a similar
magnitude. In other words we swap two big vertical forces for two
small vertical forces plus two small lateral forces. This 50%
balance factor will provide the smallest possible loading at any
given point in the cycle, and should be used by default for most
engines. It seems fashionable at the moment to "overbalance"
engines for very high rpm work, using balance factors of 60 or more
percent. Typically though, the people doing this provide no logical
or convincing reasoning for this. I guess if you had reliable data
showing that your block is stiffer laterally than vertically, or
vice-versa, then you may be able to justify some amount of under or
over balance. In the absence of this data though I'd stick with
about 50%.
Some builders like to add a few grams for oil, though how the
hell they know exactly where the oil will be clinging to the
rotating and reciprocating bits is beyond me. Some also
painstakingly balance everything to a jillionth of a gram but like
the oil thing this is just wank. If the individual components share
weights within a few grams, and the balance factor is somewhere
near an appropriate figure then it's as good as it's going to get.
Taking it to ridiculously fine tolerances will achieve no
measurable results.
We briefly looked at knife-edged cranks in the crankshaft section,
but it may pay to reiterate here: if engine durability is a factor
do not
knife-edge the counterweights. It will be impossible
to balance one of these cranks to a 50% balance factor. Your engine
builder may tell you that he can balance the modified crank perfectly
(and he probably can, at least as far as a conventional balancing machine is concerned)
but it will end up being balanced to something
like a 30% factor. For a high revving Holden six that's already
somewhat fragile I feel the slight gains from reduced weight and
windage are far outweighed by the significantly increased stresses
introduced by the cut-down counterweights.
So what do we do if we want or need to rev our engine to the
moon (and remain in one piece)? First of all we minimise the forces
by using the lightest pistons and rods available/affordable. Then,
by using a fully counterbalanced crank we can reduce the abuse the
block has to absorb by about 50%. A heavy, rigid main girdle can
also help by dampening vibrations and stiffening the block
laterally. Builders of smaller, 3" stroke engines are disadvantaged in
that counterbalanced cranks aren't available. In the Holden sixes
heyday engine builders recognized the importance of
counterbalancing and went to the trouble of welding weights to the
original steel cranks, though this will obviously be time-consuming
and/or expensive. A billet crank is another expensive alternative,
otherwise you're pretty much stuck with using a late 202 crank.
Now the bad news: with conventional balancing equipment it simply
isn't possible to balance a straight six crank to a specific balance factor. If
the crank is balanced end for end the balancing machine will show no
change in balance regardless of what bobweight you use. The only
practical way to do it is to carefully measure the crank throws and
calculate the factor theoretically. This isn't as difficult as it sounds;
CAD software can do the sums for you. And if you plan to use a billet crank
then the design software will give accurate counterweight dimensions for a given
bobweight. In the good old days people would cut up an old crank and measure
the balance of each throw individually though today that would be a last
resort. The main thing is to be aware of the limitations of the commonly used balancing
machines. The other bad news is that even the late 202 cranks aren't really
fully counterbalanced. Look closely and you'll see that although each throw
is counterweighted, the counterweights are neither consistently sized or indexed.
The end two counterweights are much bigger than the others, which are tapered and
indexed in a way to balance out the larger end weights.
They seem to be adequate for fairly high speeds and outputs for short durations, but if you're running
really high speeds and power levels - to the point where you simply can't keep the
engines in one piece - then a custom billet crank may be a worthwhile investment.
