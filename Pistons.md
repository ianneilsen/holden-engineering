How To Build A High-Performance Holden Six

Pistons
Not a lot to choose from here, at least not when compared with
whats available for the Chev motors for example. And if you plan to
build anything besides a 202 the choices are quite limited.
Don't expect to be able to buy forged pistons off the shelf; if
you need forged items you'll probably need to get them custom made
or else adapt pistons made for something else. Cast
high-silicon-content pistons are generally adequate for naturally
aspirated engines of the specific outputs we are talking about
here, though at the top end of this range the safety margin is
getting a bit thin. The main thing of course is to avoid
detonation.
More than likely you'll end up using the cast ACL Race-Series
pistons in a 202, and these seem to hold up well. The rings
supplied with these pistons have a thinner section and lower
tension than the standard type pistons, and these are a definite
advantage in higher-revving engines. There are flat top versions as
well as one with a small dish, and unlike the standard replacement
pistons the dish is offset to match the combustion chambers to help
preserve some squish. Taper wall pins are available in the
Race-Series. These piston and ring packages were designed to be
used in higher than normal output applications, and should be fine
in nearly any normally aspirated (or even lightly blown) engine.
The early 202s had a habit of breaking off the skirt of the
original pistons at high revs, though this is not a problem with
good quality aftermarket items.
On the left is a 5.71" Olds Quad4 rod with a Cadillac Northstar piston. This is a drop-in fit in a 202. Stock part on the right.
If you're building something other than a 202, your choices are
much more limited. Many people have had good results from
Duralites. These will stand up to much higher pressures and speeds
than they were originally designed for, but still you need to be
realistic in your expectations. They were never intended for very
high compression ratios, and they don't come with the thin low
tension Race-Series rings. The stock type piston/ring package
wasn't meant to do very high revs, and they will need an extra
couple of thou skirt clearance over stock for high performance
work. Be extra careful to avoid detonation with standard
replacement type pistons because they can be hammered to death very
quickly. They'd probably be OK up to about 200hp but if you are
going after every horsepower you can get it might be best to do
whatever it takes to get some forgings or at least some
Hypereutectic type castings.
One thing to keep in mind when using hypereutectic pistons is the
end gap of the top ring. This is normally set much wider than in
a normal cast or forged piston to prevent end butting. Much damage can
be done with insufficient gap so check with the piston and ring manufacturer
before you install the pistons.
The majority of stock replacement type pistons have the gudgeon pin
offset by about 0.060". The only reason for this is to reduce the tendency
for the piston to slap after a cold start - the slight imbalance created by
offsetting the pin makes the piston rock over relatively gently at TDC
instead of "slapping" laterally from one side to the other. The amount of
offset isn't great enough to have a material effect on performance, but
despite this there is a persistent old wives tale to the effect that
installing this type of pistons backwards will result in a power gain.
If you remember any high school trigonometry (or you have a crank position vs. piston position
vs. rod angle spreadsheet) you'll soon be able to work out that the small
offset will have a negligible effect on rod angularity and piston thrust loads.
And if you factor in the slight relocation of true TDC from reversing
the pistons then the effect is even smaller. If you want to put the slugs in
backwards go right ahead, you won't hurt anything. But don't expect the
output to increase by any measurable amount. Of course all this only applies
to stock style pistons - performance or racing pistons generally have zero offset.
Using longer rods or a longer stroke length requires a piston
with a higher pin height, and this can lead to problems if taken
too far. See the section on connecting rods for more detail.
