How To Build A High-Performance Holden Six

Combustion Chambers
Promoting the maximum possible turbulence in the air/fuel charge
is critical for efficient combustion. In more modern engines this
is usually done by shaping the inlet ports to encourage swirl and tumble
as the charge enters the cylinder. In our elderly Holden sixes though,
we are more reliant on the combustion chambers squish pad to stir things up.
There are useful power gains to be had by optimising the chamber
shape - specifically, at TDC we want to reduce the clearance
between the piston and the squish/quench pad to the bare minimum.
This is the flat area of the head alongside the chamber bowl, and
it's primary role is to induce turbulence in the chamber as the
piston approaches TDC. It does this by "squishing" the mixture out
of the confined space into the bowl area, but there is a downside
to this as well. Because the mixture in this area is in such close
proximity to the relatively cool metal of the head and piston, it
doesn't burn along with the rest of the cylinder charge when the
piston is at or near TDC. It either doesn't burn at all, burns only
partially or only burns when the piston is significantly past TDC
and it is too late to derive any usable work from it.
How much power can be gained? Lets look at an example engine, a
202 with 11:1 compression that makes about 220bhp. Lets assume the
quench area covers about a third of the head area, and we have a
piston to head clearance of 0.070". In this example the volume of
gas in the quench area at TDC works out to about 12cc, or roughly
22% of the total chamber volume. In other words, about a fifth of
the mixture in the chamber won't be producing any useful power.
Lets say we reduce the clearance to about 0.35", so that we now
have only about 11% of our available mixture in the quench area. In
theory at least, we have just picked up over 20hp. In the real
world of course the increase mightn't be so dramatic, but at any
rate there are good gains to be made for very little effort.
Remember that the piston crown is part of the chamber, and any
dish in the crown will have to be taken into account. Wherever
possible, it will pay to use a flat top piston, or at least try to
limit the dished area to that part of the crown that matches the
bowl area of the head. How tight should the piston to quench pad
clearance be? Basically you want to run as close as possible
without actually having the piston smack the head at high revs. And
that depends on how much piston rock there is at TDC, bearing
clearances, thermal expansion of the piston and so on. You should
be safe at 0.040", but I'd be nervous about anything less than
0.30". You can juggle the clearance by altering piston height, deck
height or gasket thickness. Obviously, if there is any sign of
piston/head contact you'd want to get a thicker gasket in there
pretty quickly.
Valve and Seat Prep
This has a major impact on flow so it's important to get it
right. Both the 9 and 12 port heads can use a simililar
treatment.
Use 5 angles for the inlet, a 70 deg cut to blend into the throat,
a 60 deg bottom cut, 45 deg seat, 30 deg top cut & 15 deg
chamber blend with a 1/4" radius. Cut the chamber relief .125" out
from the edge of the valve (provided that doesn't take you out to
the gasket with a bigger valve). On the intake valve a 30 deg
backcut will help low lift flow.
On the exhaust use 3 angles. Make about a 3/8" radius off the seat
for the bottom cut, 45 deg seat, 30 deg top cut, 15 deg
blending/relieving cut with about a 1/4" radius. Like the intake,
relieve about 1/8" out from edge of valve if possible.
