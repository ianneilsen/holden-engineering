How To Build A High-Performance Holden Six

Exhaust
The exhaust has a profound effect on performance, but to get the
maximum returns can take a lot of work. There are two basic
requirements: firstly we want a system that offers free flow with a
minimum of backpressure, and secondly we want tubes dimensioned to
provide the best possible scavenging and power output. Before we
get to specific sizes, let's take a quick look at how the exhaust
works.
Imagine the piston descending on the power stroke. Somewhere
after midstroke the exhaust valve begins to open, and the gas,
still under a fair bit of pressure, starts to flow. By the time the
piston is at BDC the pressure will be mostly relieved, and as the
piston rises it shoves more gas out the exhaust port. Clearly we
can see that excessive backpressure will incur a horsepower penalty
because of pumping losses, but in fact the losses due to pumping
are fairly low, even with substantial backpressure. Despite this
there is a good reason to limit backpressure: not only does the
remaining gas occupy volume that could be filled with fresh
mixture, but when the intake valve opens as the piston approaches
TDC the backpressure-compressed gas flows back up into the intake
port, further contaminating and diluting the fresh mixture.
The real power gains are made through better scavenging. Imagine
that the piston has now reached TDC on the exhaust stroke. The gas
in the cylinder has been swept out, but we still have a body of
exhaust gas occupying the combustion chamber - depending on the
compression ratio it could be about 10% or so of the cylinder
volume. Unless we can get rid of it the gas will rob space that
could be filled by fresh air/fuel mixture, plus it will dilute and
contaminate the mixture, slowing combustion. The way we get rid of
it is with an efficient exhaust system that uses a mixture of
inertia forces from the moving column of gas and sonic activity to
literally pull the remaining exhaust gas from the chamber. Of these
two forces, the sonic or sound wave action is the strongest. A good
illustration of the ability of sound waves to produce power is the
two-stroke racing motorcycle engine - these have extremely high
specific power outputs that are largely made possible by their
expansion chamber exhaust systems.
So how do we make it work? Firstly (and this is a grossly
simplified explanation but it'll do for the time being) we use a
primary pipe diameter that provides sufficient flow velocity that
the momentum of the column of moving gas helps pull the remaining
gas from the cylinder as the piston slows down approaching TDC.
This is a compromise of course between getting a high flow velocity
and keeping the friction losses and therefore the backpressure
down. Secondly, we try to make the primary pipe the right length so
that as the piston approaches TDC a negative pressure wave is
returned from the collector and arrives at the chamber at just the
right time to drag the last of the exhaust gases out and get the
flow started from the opening intake valve. Of course with an
exhaust system of fixed dimensions this can only work well over a
fairly narrow RPM range, so it's important to match the exhaust
system to the other engine components.
Sound waves are created when the exhaust valve first opens, and
a positive pressure wave will travel from the exhaust valve down
the primary pipe. Whenever there is a change in cross-sectional
area, another sound wave will be reflected from that point back to
the source. If the cross-sectional area decreases then the
reflected wave will be the same sign or polarity as the original
wave ie. if a positive pressure wave hits a reduced pipe area then
another positive wave will be reflected back. If however the pipe
increases in area, then the wave is reversed in "polarity" and a
negative pressure wave will be bounced back to the chamber. This is
basically how a typical collected extractor works then: the
momentum of the gas column helps pull gas from the cylinder as the
piston decelerates. Then the original positive wave produced when
the valve first opened will be bounced back from the point where
primary pipe meets the collector as a negative pressure wave at
just the right time to scavenge the chamber. Providing of course
the length is right. It all sounds neat and tidy in theory, but
it's not quite so simple in reality. In a real exhaust there will
be other changes in cross section besides those at the collector,
where other cylinder pipes branch into primary pipes for example.
As well, there will be pressure waves from some cylinders setting
up waves in pipes from other cylinders and the end result is that
there are dozens of waves of different signs and amplitudes
rattling back and forth in the system, some beneficial, some not
so. Get the dimensions right though, and it all works rather
well.
OK, so much for theory, what size pipes do I need for my 202?
Well that depends. A tuned system can only work well over a fairly
narrow rev range, so for a mild to moderate street car that
operates over a wide RPM range I wouldn't even bother with sonic
tuning. I'd simply use a set of off-the shelf extractors with the
appropriate primary pipe size. In fact, for engines up to about
160hp the factory dual outlet cast manifolds will often perform as
well as extractors. The dual manifolds were made for some of the
red engines (186S for example) and were standard on all the
blue/black engines. Compared to tube extractors they are cheap,
quiet, leak-free and long lasting, so don't discount them for the
daily hack. For a mild 12 port engine the factory VK EFI extractors
are a good choice - the small diameter but long primaries help build torque
where it's needed most.
The factory VK header is an excellent choice
for 12 port street engines, but manifold clearance can be an issue.
How then do we design a system for a high output engine with a
narrow rev range? We need some starting point for the dimensions in
order to reduce experimental cut and shut to a minimum. Designing a
tuned system can involve enough calculations to fill a book, and
indeed there have been several books written on the subject. The
easy way - and I love easy ways - is to use software to do the sums
for you. Any of the engine simulation programs can do this, plus
there are programs specifically for pipe design as well as free
online calculators. Interestingly, if you use several of these to
design a system for the same engine you'll find they don't all come
up with exactly the same dimensions. They will however come up with
figures that will be close enough to get you started, and the
experimental optimization work will be kept to a minimum should you
choose to do it.
OK, here's another very very rough guide: for smaller engines
(say less than 179ci) of up to 120 - 130 hp use 1.375" to 1.437"
primary pipes. It may be difficult to match your exhaust ports to
these small tubes and if so don't stress, just use 1-1/2" pipes.
For engines of 130 to about 200 hp use 1.5" tubes. From 200hp to
about 275hp 1-5/8" pipes will be about right, and once you go from
275hp to well into the 300's (probably not with a Holden head!) you
could probably even make good use of 1-3/4" tubing.
HM Headers HM9C - widely regarded as the best
off-the-shelf competition headers
As for primary pipe length you really need to calculate this for
each individual engine as it is influenced by valve timing as well
as other factors. Engines at the high end (torque peaks above 6000
-6500rpm) will probably like about 27 - 28", more moderate engines
around 30" and streetable engines around 32 - 34", though really
you should calculate this yourself or use the appropriate software.
Ideally all the primary tubes should be exactly the same length,
and most off the shelf extractors will have quite a lot of length
variation. Having said that, I'd rather have extractors where at
least some of the tubes were roughly the right length than a set
where all the tubes were the same incorrect length. The straight
six has much more room to fit exhaust manifolding compared to a V8,
but even so you may come across primary pipes that dive down at a
sharp angle right from the port face. Traditionally it has been
recommended to leave a few
inches of straightish pipe at the flange before making any sharp bends.
Considering what the exhaust gas had to go through to get to the port
face I'm not sure whether it's really important - if you have to make a sudden
change in direction you might as well get it over and done with while the flow
is still turbulent on exiting the port. And remember that the exhaust port in the Holden heads is
directed down at a slight angle. Check the port match at the flange
and head face, some extractors are way off and will need a bit of
work with the die grinder. Some also need help with maintaining alignment
with the head. You can sometimes improve the flow on
primaries that dive down sharply by grinding a big "short-side"
radius on the lower inside edge of the header flange.
To continue our rough and somewhat dodgy guide over at the
collector end, you'll probably find good results using a collector
with an area of roughly 1.8 to 2.2 times the primary pipe area - the Holden
seems to like collectors that are on the smallish side.
Thus for 1-1/2" pipes use a 2" collector, for 1-5/8"
primaries a 2-1/4" to 2-3/8" collector, and for 1-3/4" pipes a 2-1/2" to 2-3/4" collector.
If you have time to spare you may find you can broaden the
powerband somewhat by making the collector tapered, ie. make the
collector entry area no more than double the primary area, with the
outlet area about three times the primary area. The collector length isn't as
critical as the other dimensions, and if you use a length equal to
about 6 or 8 diameters you'll be close. Making the collectors longer
often helps build torque at the lower end of the curve.
So-called merge collectors have been in fashion for the
last few years. These usually make less peak power than a conventional
collector.
Merge collectors have become popular with some and are interesting
enough to warrant a closer look. When these first came onto the scene most
of the competion header manufacturers warned against them, citing power decreases
or at least no worthwhile improvements. Since then many have realised that there
are potential dollars to be made from convincing customers to "upgrade" so now they are widely available.
The main difference between these and
conventional collectors is the way the ends of the primary pipes gradually
merge together into a small diameter throat. Theoretically they should
flow better than the conventional type but there are a few things to watch
out for. The main one being that merge collectors will normally return a much
weaker negative wave back to the open exhaust valve, and this would usually mean
that peak power and torque is reduced. Why is this? Remember how any sudden change
in cross-sectional area will result in a wave being reflected back from this point?
The more rapid the change in area the stronger this reflected wave will be.
So the typical merge collector with its gentle expansion will return a weaker
wave, though it may be of a longer duration and be useful over a slightly wider
rpm range. You could of course flare the collector suddenly to overcome this
but then you might as well just use a conventional unit.
The other thing to watch out for is the primary length. This is normally
considered to be the distance from the exhaust valve to the first sudden increase
in cross-sectional area. This is pretty straightforward to establish with
a conventional collector but is a bit vague with a merge collector. It
may take some trial and error but will most likely end up somewhere around
the downstream end of the collector throat. In other words if you try to measure
the primaries in the same way you'd do it with a conventional collector
you'll almost certainly end up with pipes that are too long.
So are merge collectors worth trying? Personally I'd have no hesitation
using them on a turbocharged engine (where I think they do have some genuine
merit) but for a N/A engine they'd be one of the last items I'd be testing
in the search for more power - if I bothered with them at all.
If you need to run a full system with tailpipe and muffler these
need to be as big or a tad bigger than the collector to maintain
power. The downside to running such a big system on a street car is
that they tend to be "boomey" and the drone quickly becomes
annoying. It may be better to run a smaller, quieter system on the
street that can be quickly disconnected at the strip. Popular
opinion states that pipes bigger than 2-1/4" or 2-1/2" will reduce
low rpm torque, but these pipe sizes may be too small for very high
output engines which may require anything up to a 3" system. I know
from experience that some engines
feel
stronger down low
with a smaller pipe, but I suspect this is an illusion caused by
the smaller, quieter pipe. Best performance will come from using a
pipe sufficiently big that it appears to the engine to be dumping
straight to the atmosphere from the collector. As mentioned earlier
though, such a big system may be difficult to accomodate and be
annoyingly drummy. A big glass-pack style muffler (the longer the better)
mounted immediately downstream of the collector can help here; to the engine
it appears to be dumping directly from the collector, and it reduces
the need to run such a large system after the glass-pack. The other
advantage to this setup is that it permits the use of a clearly defined
collector length; pipe after the collector can appear to the engine to
be simply additional collector length. But if you use this approach make
sure the glass-pack is at least 1/2" bigger than the collector diameter, other wise
it will simply act as a collector extension.
Big, baffled mufflers are quieter and sometimes flow as well as
or better than the straight-through absorbtion types, even though
they are more difficult to accomodate neatly. OEM mufflers from
late model injected engines of a similar or (preferably) greater
output should perform well, at least as well as the so-called
sports designs, and should be cheaply available from the wreckers.
The Hooker Maximum Flow range is very good, and if money is tight I've
always had good results from the traditional Thrush Turbo mufflers. Just be aware
that some of the big names amongst so-called performance mufflers aren't
all that effective so choose carefully.
Single systems are generally regarded to be best from a performance
perspective, though it should be noted that manufacturers such as
BMW have fitted dual exhausts to their cars as standard - and if
anyone knows high performance straight sixes it's BMW. Their use of
dual pipes may be more due to the fact that it's sometimes easier
to fit two small pipes rather than one big one though. Regardless,
I would stick with a single system unless I had a very good reason
to do otherwise.
Hookers' Maximum Flow range of mufflers effectively reduce the noise
output without diminishing performance below that of an open system.
If there is one piece of advice you should follow it is this: don't
just guess the exhaust dimensions or use what worked on your mates engine.
Use something like PipeMax to calculate the sizes so you can be confident
of being fairly close to the optimum right from the start. And be prepared to
do some experimentation if you're after every potential horsepower.
