Unshrouding the Valves and relieving the bores
In both types of head the valves are very badly shrouded, and
the bigger the valve you use, the worse it is shrouded. But with a
stock or very mildly modified head the shrouding is a surprisingly
minor problem - the stock ports flow so badly that unshrouding
the valves has a negligible effect on flow. Once the ports have been
tidied up though, further gains are definitely possible through unshrouding.
At the
outer side of the chamber it is impossible to get much more than
about 0.1" of clearance with big valves, so the shrouding effect
can never be entirely eliminated. On the port side of the chamber
it's fairly easy to grind some clearance but to get the ideal means
removing lots of material and therefore grinding into the water
jacket is a risk. The spark plug side of the head is where
most of the flow will be at higher speeds, and again a lot of
material will have to be removed so be cautious and study your
cut-up head carefully. Use a head gasket as a guide to how far you
can take the chamber wall. Of course this makes the step or ledge
at the top of the cylinder bigger but the benefits of reduced
shrouding far outweigh the increased turbulence from the ledge.
Ideally the wall immediately around the valve head will slope back
about 45 degrees, so that the distance from the wall to the valve
is always about the same as the distance the valve is off its seat.
In practice you mightn't be quite able to achieve this but it's
critical that you get it as good as you possibly can. If you get
the chance to run tests on a flow bench you will see that even
minute increases in the distance from wall to valve will improve
the flow (with a good port). If you are fitting oversize valves consider using
eccentric valve guides to shift the valve towards the centre of the
cylinder. Even if you only shift the valve say 0.040" to 0.060" you
will pick up useful gains in flow. Again though, the water jackets
around the bowls may be a limiting factor.
Unshrouding large valves requires removing lots of
material so take care to avoid making the chamber walls too
thin.
Relieving the Top of the Bore
The chamber in the head is wider than the cylinder bore, so this means we have
a ledge or step on each side that the flow has to negotiate on its way in or
out of the cylinder. If you lay a head gasket
on a cylinder head you will see that the openings aren't perfectly
round, and match the shape of the chamber. Now lay the gasket on
the block deck, and you can visualise the step or ledge under the
chamber. Obviously the smaller the cylinder bore, the bigger the
ledge, and it's a good reason to use the biggest available bore
size. Practically every hot-rodded Holden six in the country has had chamfers
ground into the cylinder top in order to ease the flow around these steps. I've done it, you
probably have too, but I'm not sure that it's a good idea.
Let's backtrack a bit. These ledges are actually quite common in GM engines;
go back through the years and you'll find plenty of straight and vee type engines
featuring chamber overhang. The funny thing is when you look at the valve
sizing and spacing, the chamber doesn't
have
to overhang. In other words
the step is intentional. Why? Well, a sharp edge like this is extremely effective
in shearing wet flow into a nicely atomised mixture, and I guess this is why it
was incorporated. Remember that even an injected engine will have wet flow here.
The other thing is that adding chamfers adds surprisingly little to the flow.
Whack a decent head on your flow bench with a plain 3.62" adaptor and check the flow.
Now grind two chamfers into the adaptor and check it again. With very good-flowing
heads there is a very small improvement, but with anything less there is virtually
no change. And even where the flow does improve, does it make up for the loss of
mixture preparation? I don't know, I just know that I rarely bother with the chamfers
anymore, certainly not with a street car anyway..
If you do decide to do this I'd be careful not to go too
deep. The chamfer will definitely expose the part of the piston
above the top ring to a lot of heat so I'd be wary of going more
than about 3mm deep, depending of course on the top ring position.
Relocating the Head
You'll probably find that the valve will still be slightly
shrouded on the spark plug side even if you grind back to the
gasket. What you can do to improve this is move the head towards
the manifold side of the block by about 2mm. You will need to
elongate the dowel holes in the head (don't just yank the pins out
because they are needed to accurately locate the gasket) and also
the bolt holes. Provided you don't get carried away you won't have
too many dramas getting the water holes lined up, but don't forget
to check pushrod clearance through the head. The extra couple of
millimetres that can be ground from the sparkplug side wall will
improve flow slightly and will also help enable further gains from
port work. Realistically though, the gains will be very small.
