Blocks for Continuous High Horsepower
Applications
The little Holden seems to be able to handle much higher power
levels for shorts bursts quite well, and indeed there are some
very
high powered blown drag race engines around. But if you
run the engine for prolonged periods at horsepower levels over the
high 200s you will probably find the block will be quite
susceptible to cracking and splitting, and while there are some
things you can do to help there are definite limits to how much
power can be made reliably. Pushed hard, they will split
horizontally right down the left hand side, the crack intersecting
the welch plug holes. Very high rpms seem to be the main cause of
the breakages, though builders of blown motors in may also have to
choose between higher boost levels and block durability.
The breakages seem to be more a result of vibrations and forces
transferred through the block from the crank rather than simple
overstressing. It's therefore more productive to focus attention on
the preparation and balancing of the rotating assembly than to try
to strengthen the block itself - see the sections on the crankshaft
and balancing for more detail.
Running a steel girdle on the mains might help to some degree,
though there seems to be remarkably few problems with main caps
walking or breaking, the main benefit of a heavy rigid girdle is as
a vibration dampener. Grout filling the block will also help dampen
the harmonics to a degree, and also provide a little more cylinder
wall stiffness. The amount of grout fill will of course will be a
compromise between stiffness and cooling, particularly for engines
running petrol rather than methanol. The top 30mm - 40mm of the
cylinder is the section that is under the most stress, and is
therefore the bit that would most benefit from some grout support.
Unfortunately this would also preclude any coolant circulation so
would only work with a drag engine. You can however run some grout
in the lower part of the water jackets without any overheating
problems even in a street or circuit car, and it will help stiffen
the cylinders a little bit. Filling to the bottom of the water pump
opening will result in about 50mm of grout around the base of the
cylinders, and while it's not really where the support is most
needed it will help a bit.
In an attempt to strengthen the block, some guys have run long
head studs that run through the deck and are anchored into holes
tapped into the block at the bottom of the cylinders, and this will
certainly help tie things together. It's not practical to do this
on the cam side as the outer block wall prevents a straight shot
from the deck to the base, but on the welch plug side where the
support is needed most it's fairly easy to do. Unfortunately the
block is quite thin at the base of the cylinders so drilling and
tapping will probably weaken this area seriously - and remember
this is also where the main webs are anchored. You may be tempted
to run long studs all the way from the main caps to the head, but
even if you somehow get past the cam-side wall the studs will then
intersect the oil passages and you'll be removing material from an
area that can ill afford it. Not only that, you'll have to somehow
seal around the studs to prevent coolant leakage into the sump and
also at the head end. It mightn't be impossible, but I seriously
doubt it would be worth the effort and the end result could well be
a block that is weaker than it was originally.
To summarise, prolonged high power/high rpm levels
will be problematic for any block. Drag or street engines should
have few problems but for applications such as circuit racing it's
something to consider. The way to help the block survive is not by
working on the block itself, but by using the lightest possible
pistons and rods with a properly balanced counterweighted
crankshaft. More details in the relevant section. For engines that
are less than very highly tuned - and any remotely sensible street
engine - block breakage is unlikely to be much of a problem, even
with a non-counterweighted crank.
