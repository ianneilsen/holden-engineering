Block Prep
For engines of not too much more than 200hp there is nothing
special required, unless of course you plan on using a different
type of crank. The age of these blocks dictate that you should give
any block a good clean and check it out thoroughly for cracks or
any other damage before you invest any time or money in it. Given the
little Holdens tendency towards excessive blowby it's a very good idea to
sonically test the cylinder wall thickness to make sure that the block
is suitable for use. There are however a few things be aware of when
sonic testing (especially for the inexperienced) so we'll
take a closer look at the subject in the next section.
Line boring isn't usually required, though cutting material from the
deck might be be needed to get the squish/quench clearance down -
more on this later. Keep an eye out for cracking around the head
bolt holes which is quite common, though minor cracks here don't
seem to cause any problems. These holes also tend to pull the top couple of threads
so consider fitting inserts and/or studs while you're at it.
Traditionally it's been thought that a honing
plate (or deck plate or torque plate) absolutely must be used for the final honing
operation of any performance engine. And with some engines - the 400 SBC comes
to mind  - this makes very good sense. But I don't think it really matters
with the Holden six. Try this exercise: mike up the bores of a 202 then
fit a gasket and deck plate and torque it all down tightly. Remeasure it
and you'll probably find the bores don't change much at all - probably less than a tenth
or two of a thou. I don't bother with deck plates at all anymore - if
you want to use one it won't hurt but probably won't help either.
Bore finish is critically important,
and should match the rings requirements. Generally a 280 grit stone
will be best for chrome rings and a 400 grit for moly or moly-plasma
faced rings. Honing technique is critical to get a good wall finish
so it should be entrusted to an experienced specialist; not a backyarder
with a Makita and a cheap hone.
It's generally accepted that an automatic machine can give a
better, more consistent result than hand honing and I see no reason to do it
any other way.
We touched on the importance of maintaining the maximum possible
cylinder wall thickness earlier; trouble is it's getting hard to
find blocks that haven't already been rebored several times, and
anyway you could argue that a very high HP engine would benefit
from walls stiffer than those in a virgin block. This can be
achieved through sleeving with high-strength thinwall sleeves. The
success of such an operation though rests almost entirely on the
person doing the machining. If the job is done properly, a sleeved
engine will make more power, have more strength and last longer
than a normal unsleeved block. If the machining isn't 100% though,
it will fail quickly and this is probably why sleeved blocks have a
poor reputation with some. The sleeve and block must be machined to
very close tolerances, and the sleeve must press up against a step
or shoulder to ensure a reliable seal with the head gasket. It's
not practical to use sleeving as a means to enlarge the bore; in
order to maintain a reasonable thickness of material around the
sleeve and in the sleeve itself you'll probably end up with a bore
no bigger than standard and possibly a bit smaller. The improvement
in wall stiffness will more than compensate for the smaller
capacity, especially with very highly tuned engines. Sleeving a
high revving high output engine is a different matter altogether to
sleeving something like a worn out tractor engine - you might have
to talk to several engine machinists before you find one with the
experience and competence to do it correctly. Properly done though,
there are definite strength and performance benefits to be had.
