How To Build A High-Performance Holden Six

Tuning
If you think you can tune accurately by the seat of your pants
and/or by reading spark plugs you're kidding yourself. The only way
to do it is to accurately measure the performance, whether it's by
dyno, drag strip speeds or one of the in-car devices.
Many years ago I had a car that ran well, actually I thought it
was pretty close to being tuned spot on, using only plug readings
and the seat of my pants. I bought one of those in-car timers that
measures 0-30mph, 0-60mph, 1/4 mile ET and terminal speed. It sat
on the bench for months but eventually I got around to fitting it.
I took the car (and my jet collection) out one afternoon and was
amazed by the usefulness of this little tool. Within half an hour
I'd picked up nearly half a second and a few mile an hour. A couple
of hours later the total gain was almost a full second. The
surprising thing was that sometimes I would make a change that made
the car feel slower when it actually went quicker, and sometimes it
was vice-versa. Since then I've considered these inexpensive
devices to be one of the best investments that can be made in
improving performance. The thing I like about them is they can be
used anytime you like, providing you have access to a suitable
stretch of road.
Typical in-car accelerometer. Can show 0-60, ET, terminal speed, horsepower etc.
Another useful tool is an air/fuel ratio gauge coupled to a wideband
O2 sensor. These can help you get the jetting or fuel map in the
ballpark pretty quickly, although the final setting should still be
done by measuring the cars actual performance.

Probably the best approach is to set the ignition timing first,
then spend some time on jetting - incorrect timing can give a misleading
indication of mixture strength. Repeat the
process to fine tune - you might have do it a couple of times. When
you get it right you'll probably find that there is a range of a
couple of jet sizes and a couple of degrees of advance where the
performance barely changes. It's safest to be on the richer,
less-advanced end of this range. If you're running a solid lifter
cam you might also want to experiment with minor changes in valve
clearances, and if you find significant gains from this it might
indicate that a change in cam timing or a whole new cam would be
beneficial. When you're tuning at the drag strip or with an in car
timer concentrate mainly on the terminal speeds as these are an
accurate indication of the engines output, whereas the ET is
subject to variations in driving technique and how well you hook up
off the line. You will find the terminal speeds surprisingly
consistant, even if you stuff up the launch or gear changes etc.
Not that I'd ever do that...
Earlier I mentioned that power output and fuel consumption are
the two key indicators of engine efficiency. There are another
couple of more subtle indicators you might want to keep an eye on
too, and they are the jetting and timing requirements. Basically if
the engine seems to want unusually rich jetting it's a sign of poor
mixture quality and/or distribution, or perhaps overcarburation.
Get that fixed and you'll find the engine will make more power and
will want a smaller jet. Similarly, if the engine wants great gobs
of spark advance at either end of the rev range then something
isn't quite right, possibly not enough squish or a mismatch of
compression ratio to cam timing. There is a difference though,
between an efficient engine that makes peak power with moderate
spark advance and one that can only tolerate so much advance before
it rattles like a paint tin full of marbles..
