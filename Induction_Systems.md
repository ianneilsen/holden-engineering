How To Build A High-Performance Holden Six

Induction - Carbs, Manifolds and
Injection
What do we want from an induction system? How about this?
A sufficient volume of air and fuel
to allow the engine to develop its maximum potential power
Fuel
mixed thoroughly with the air, and in particle sizes uniformly
small so they burn quickly and completely
Uniform mixture
distribution from cylinder to cylinder
Satisfying number one is easy; it's just a matter of making
everything big enough . Number two is a bit harder, and seems to be
particularly challenging for certain popular American carburetors.
Number three depends mainly on manifolding, with some types it
takes care of itself, others will take some work to get right. So
how do we know when we have got it right? There are two key
indicators, firstly the engine will make good power. And secondly
it will have good fuel consumption relative to the power produced.
I know this is supposed to be about high performance engines but it
really is important to monitor fuel consumption as well; it's a
sure sign of how efficiently the engine is running as a whole.
Every now and again you might hear some young bloke tell you how he
has built an engine so incredibly powerful he can barely back it
out the driveway without refilling the tank. The correct response
of course is to smile and nod, and to think to yourself: "You
fuckwit. If you ever get that thing running properly it will make
twice as much power and use a fraction of the fuel." Even a triple
carbed, long-overlap cammed engine should give reasonably good
mileage on the freeway, very similar to a stock engine with similar
gearing if everything is set up right. So if your engine turns out
to be thirsty in normal use, rest assured there is more power to be
had by getting it to run efficiently. A good illustration of whats
possible is the modern fuel injected engine; these are making much
more power and torque than the engines of say 30 years ago, but at
the same time using much less fuel and putting out less emissions.
Burning every drop of fuel as completely as possible isn't just
good for mileage, it's good for horsepower levels too.
Probably the biggest challenge related to induction systems is
finding a well designed manifold - there are literally dozens of
different types available but unfortunately the majority of them
are extremely poorly designed. Don't be surprised to find you have
to fabricate your manifold.
Injection or Carbs
So which is best? It depends. A well sorted injection set up
will outperform poorly done carburettors, just as well tuned carbs
will run rings around badly tuned injectors. What it really comes
down to is where your knowledge and experience lie. If you've spent
years tuning SU's for example you could probably have an SU
equipped engine running optimally pretty quickly. Conversely, if
you know EFI inside out and have the right gear then injection is
the obvious choice. While injection theoretically has a slight
power advantage and is easier to live with day to day (if it's
correctly set up) I think it's much more important to pick whatever
you can tune accurately in a reasonable timeframe. In other words
it's irrelevant which system has the most potential, what matters
is which system
you
can get the most from.
Types of Induction Systems
We'll come back to injection systems later... in the meantime
we'll check out the two basic carburetor/manifold layouts: common
plenum systems and individual runner (IR) systems. We'll look at
the IR systems first..
