How To Build A High-Performance Holden Six
Building the hot holden six

Ignition
Short version: If all you need is an ignition system for a high output N/A Holden six any good quality factory or aftermarket setup will
do the job nicely, whether it be inductive (eg. HEI) or CDI. Even points 'n coil will suffice, the main thing is that whatever
you use it has an appropriate timing curve.
Long (very long) version: This section is a lot longer than I'd originally intended - not that selecting a suitable ignition
is particularly difficult, it's just that
there is so much dodgy information out there. Basically all that's needed is a spark of sufficient energy to light the fire consistently
and at the right time. Unfortunately this simple task is clouded by misinformation so let's start by studying some myths. Keep
in mind most of what follows applies mainly to high output N/A engines and that highly turbocharged and/or nitro burners will have
different requirements.
Myth 1 - A racing engine demands a much "hotter" ignition system than a stocker
. Have you ever fitted a high output ignition to an engine, and found that it started easier, idled more smoothly and generally felt sharper around town? I bet a lot of you have. I'll also bet you couldn't wait to get it to the strip and see how much faster it went with that shiny new box fitted . And again, I'll bet that once the timing was sorted that the new ignition didn't take even a fraction of a tenth off your ET and that performance stayed essentially the same.
There's a reason for this: a healthy N/A engine that makes power to say 6500 or 7500rpm has a quite modest spark requirement. Cylinder pressures aren't excessively high and there is a lot of turbulence at those speeds. Mixture strength and uniformity will also be good so overall
getting the fire lit will be pretty easy. Points and coil will make as much power as anything else provided that (A) you have no plug fouling issues,
(B) the points have enough spring tension to resist bouncing at maximum rpms and (C) low rpm performance isn't paramount. Any decent system of any
type will suffice.
Myth 2 - Street engines don't need a lot of spark energy
, or at least as not as much as a racer. In reality street engines are amongst those that benefit the most from a high energy spark.  At low rpms there isn't much turbulence in the chamber and the fuel mixture may be patchy. There may also be some exhaust dilution present (either intentionally via EGR or as a byproduct of reversion from cam overlap). Mixtures are often
extremely lean as a result of trying to comply with mileage or emission standards. Because of all this a street engine usually
shows more improvement from ignition upgrades than a race engine and is one of the most demanding environments ignition wise. A high energy system
can make a street car start easier, idle smoother and run more cleanly at small throttle openings, where a street car spends most of its time.
Myth 3 - Voltage matters
- Many ignition components (particularly coils) are marketed with claims of higher voltages, the implication being
that a coil rated at say 50,000 volts is better than one rated at 30,000 volts. There are a couple of problems with this. Firstly,
if it only takes 18000 or 20000 volts to initiate the spark then thats all the voltage that the spark plug will ever see. Regardless
of whether you use a 30k or a 50k coil the peak voltage at the plug will be the same. And secondly, the lower voltage coil will
probably be the one that produces the hotter spark. Higher voltage coils use a greater ratio of turns in the secondary and primary
windings to achieve the higher voltage. For example a 200:1 coil can potentially produce a higher voltage than one with say a 70:1
winding ratio. The trouble is that the high potential voltage is achieved at the expense of current. Providing the low voltage coil
can initiate the spark it will probably have a higher level of spark energy. Thankfully the trend seems to be away from the high voltage units
and today the most effective coils seem to be using lower winding ratios (around 70 to 100:1) with the so called E-core design. The
E-core (as used in the HEI Bosch and Delco coils for example) is a more efficient design than the old style oil filled canisters.
Myth 4 - Multiple sparks are an advantage
. It'd be more accurate to say that multiple sparks are a necessity with CDI systems.
We'll cover the differences between inductive and CDI ignitions later but for now all
we need to know is that an inductive system produces a spark that lasts many times longer than a spark from a CDI. Early CDIs
were single spark and it was often found that at low rpms - say under 3500rpm - that misfiring was a severe problem. The CDI spark occurs
so briefly that a single spark often fails to find a chunk of ignitable mixture. This is why nearly all modern CDIs make multiple
sparks under 3500rpm - it's the only way to ensure reliable ignition at low speeds. However multiple sparks show no real advantage
over an inductive system that produces a long duration high energy spark at low speeds.
Now lets take a quick look at the two commonly used ignition designs - inductive and capacitor discharge ignitions.
Inductive systems apply a voltage across the primary winding of the coil, and when this voltage is removed a much higher voltage is
induced in the secondary winding and it's this that creates the spark. Examples of inductive systems include the old points triggered
system as well as the Bosch and Delco HEI systems. As well as these most of the factory electronic dissies and nearly all of the factory
systems that are triggered by the ECU are inductive. This includes most multi-coil and coil-on-plug systems. Inductive systems have limitations
and advantages. Limitations include the number of sparks that can be produced within a given time. This is more likely to be a
problem with fixed-dwell systems (eg. points) and engines with many cylinders and/or very high rpms. In practice, even a single-coil
system can reliably fire a six cylinder engine to quite high rpm levels. Another disadvantage is that they tend to draw more current
than a CDI system of equivalent output, and spark quality can be a bit inconsistent when mechanical points are used as the trigger.
The main advantage of inductive systems is that they produce a very long duration spark - at higher rpms it can easily span 20 degrees
or more of crankshaft rotation. This means that there is no need for more than one spark at any speed and that low rpm performance
with modern inductive systems is exceptionally good. This is why the OEMs have mainly stayed with inductive systems with their factory
performance engines.  Modern inductive systems outperform the old point'n'coil for a number of reasons. Electronic triggers collapse
the primary current more quickly than points and can handle a higher current. And of course the operation of an electronic trigger
will be more consistent and won't degrade over time like points will. Modern systems will have some means of varying the dwell to
reduce the current load at low rpm as well as helping to maintain spark strength at higher rpms. Some aftermarket systems step up
the voltage applied to the primary side from 12v to 16-18v. There are some add-ons available - rpm limiters for example - but not as
many as for CDI systems. For many applications however,a simple inductive ignition is entirely adequate. Some inductive ignitions
(eg. Delco HEIs) are totally self contained so installation or replacement is as simple as dropping in the dissie and connecting
the two (power and tacho) wires.
Capacitor discharge ignitions work somewhat differently. In these a capacitor is charged up to a relatively high voltage (400 -
500v) and then this voltage is applied to the coil primary. The spark is produced when this high volage is applied, not when it
is removed as in an inductive system. CDI's have their own advantages and disadvantages. The main characteristic of a CDI spark is
its extremely fast rise time. In other words the voltage rises extremely quickly to the point that a spark occurs. This is a very
useful thing indeed to have with any engine that has a tendency to foul plugs.  A CDI can usually fire fairly wet or oily plugs and
will work particularly well on things like two-strokes. The other characteristic of the CDI spark is its very short duration, the
reason multiple sparks are necessary to ensure ignition at lower rpms. There is no tendency for the spark energy to diminish with
higher rpms and there is really no limit to the amount of energy that can be produced. Systems are available that will fire highly
boosted engines as well as extremely high output units that will light up a blown fuel dragster engine. There is a wide variety of
add-ons available, including rpm limiters, manual or automatic timing retards (controlled by RPM or MAP for example) and some units have these features as built in. For the average high performance N/A Holden six they will show no power advantage over a good inductive ignition, but for
highly boosted engines, or those using alternative fuels or requiring sophisticated controls they are certainly the way to go.
Now that we've had a brief look at the fundamentals let's look at some specific systems, starting with the factory HEI distributors.
The HEI ignitions were originally designed to
help meet emission standards on engines with impossibly lean
mixtures that were poorly distributed, and diluted with EGR gases.
To do this required an ignition that produced quite high spark
energy over a wide gap. The Bosch (and the Delco) did the job nicely, and continued
to work well even at high revs. If you use one of these make
sure you also use a compatible coil. In an early model car you may
need to fit a relay to make sure the ignition gets a full 12 volt
supply. The HEI was originally used with extremely wide gaps, but
for high hp use seems to prefer a plug gap of around 40 to 50thou.
The Bosch HEI dissies have a plastic drive gear as standard, and although
they are only lightly loaded they have been known to fail. This is
probably more to do with old age rather than any weakness, but
whatever the reason, it would probably pay to renew the gear. The
earlier metal gear will fit, but stick with a plastic one. It helps
to dampen some of the torsional vibrations that make their way to the
distributor that would tend to scatter the spark timing. While
you're at it, check the shaft and bushes for wear, and also check
the advance mechanism. If you've had the module removed for any
reason make sure you use a thin layer of thermally conductive
grease (try electronics/computer parts suppliers) underneath it to
prevent heat related breakdown.
I've always been a fan of Delco dissies (both points and HEI versions).
I like the big cap with the widely spaced terminals that helps prevent crossfire,
and I especially like the way the advance mechanism is right on top so you
can change weights and springs without removing anything more than the cap and rotor.
Back when I was playing mainly with Chevs I dabbled with some aftermarket stuff and
MSD, Mallory and Accel all got some (a lot, actually) of my money.
Once I got the advance curve right with these units they all went exactly as fast
as the Delco, so wherever possible that's what I've stuck with ever since.
Recently I decided to look into using them on the little six - while the Bosch HEIs are very good, they're getting old and worn
and it's a pain in the arse changing the advance curve on them. As it turns out it's almost trivially easy to adapt a Delco HEI
from an AMC Jeep 232-258ci six cylinder to the Holden engine. The shaft size is the same, and the diameter of the body where it slips into the block
is also the same. The only differences are the gear and a slightly longer distance from the tip of the body to the collar. 
Here are the conversion details for anyone wanting to make the swap:
Knock the roll pin out and remove the gear. Pull the shaft out from the top (obviously after removing cap and rotor)
Use a small socket or similar to tap the bottom bush up into the body about 3/8"
Trim the bottom of the dissy body to give about 1-1/8" from the bottom of the collar to the bottom of the
body (if you hacksaw this make sure you dress the base perfectly square and flat)
Blow any chips out of the body and slip the shaft back in, then refit the thrust washer and the Holden drive gear. Mark the shaft so you can cut off
the excess.
Pull the shaft out again and trim it. Use soft jaws to hold it so as not to mark the shaft.
Oil the bushes then refit the shaft, washer and Holden gear. Drill a 3/16" hole through the shaft using the
original Holden gear as a guide. Get someone to help you eyeball this to keep it all square if necessary.
Obviously you'll want to use a metal gear for this operation even if you'll be using a nylon gear in actual use.
Tap in the roll pin and check that the end float is OK and shim if necessary. Fit the rotor and cap.
That's it, the whole operation probably takes less time than it takes to change springs in a Bosch.
You now have a dissy with enough energy to run a six at 8000rpm+ and will be able
to make advance curve changes in minutes without even pulling the dissy. Spring and weight kits are readily available for a few dollars.
The one in the photo is a repro HEI dissy with adjustable vac. advance and a lifetime warranty that cost me a whopping US$53 + freight, and it
takes standard HEI replacement parts. The US racers in classes that must use stock ignitions swear by the Davis DUI dissies that
are a bit more expensive at about US$300, however the quality is said to be very good. If you go with one of the cheaper ones
take the time to check the rotor to cap phasing. The cheapy in the photo had the rotor nowhere near aligned with the cap posts at the time of firing,
however once this was corrected it performed well.

The Davis Unified Ignition racing HEIs are a very good choice for
a competition engine where a distributorless setup isn't permitted.
What about points ignitions? They can perform adequately to
fairly high rpms and are mandatory in some classes. Their main
drawback is the increased maintenance requirement, and for this
reason I'd always go for a HEI ignition where these are permitted.
The available energy from points ignitions may also be a bit marginal
for engines using high boost pressures and/or fuels other than petrol.
Dual point Mallory distributors work well and have an adjustable advance
mechanism. These units were once quite popular and are still fairly easy
to find. If you are limited to a standard distributor the Bosch GB752 points
have a higher spring rate and are better suited to high rpm use.
Capacitor Discharge Ignition systems (CDI) are  available in a multitude of configurations and energy levels
from a number of manufacturers, the best known being MSD. There are simply too many to cover here in any detail - suffice
to say that the higher energy ones (eg the "7"s) would be a good choice for blown or heavily nitroused engines. They
generally have a much wider range of available accessories (eg. limiters) and are much more expensive than most inductive
systems. They work extemely well in applications that need ultra high energy but for most N/A engines will show no advantage.
A magneto is yet another option, and would be a natural choice for any
vehicle that runs without a battery and/or alternator. They were once
quite common on competition cars, but not so much these days. Provided
they are in good condition they can perform quite well. The red six was
sometimes used in industrial applications eg. to drive a concrete agitator or
a welder or compressor. These sometimes were factory fitted with magnetos
that eventually found their way onto race cars but unless you need a self powered ignition
one of the HEI dissies would probably be a better choice. For extremely
demanding applications eg. a blown alcohol engine, one of the modern
electronically trigged mags would be the best - albeit expensive - choice.
EFI users have the option of ditching the distributor
altogether, thereby doing away with all the timing inaccuracies
introduced by the mechanical dissy. Of course there is no reason
this hardware can't be used with a carbed engine; it's just that
most injection ECUs will have ignition capabilities built in
anyway. Builders of higher-revving engines (say 6000rpm and up) should
also consider swapping the distributor for a crank triggered ignition.
The HEI units can easily provide sparks at a sufficiently high rate;
the problem is that at higher revs there will always be some amount
of torsional vibration of the crank and this will be passed along
to the cam and distributor. This vibration can seriously affect
the ignitions performance. Ideally the trigger should be located
at the flywheel end, where the torsional vibration isn't quite
so severe. Trigger points can be attached to the back of the flywheel or flexplate
and the inductive sensor mounted under the rear of the crankshaft.
There are many advantages to such a system besides reducing the
effects of torsional vibration. The timing curve can be set to any
shape you want via a laptop, and you can have different maps for
different fuels. Rev limiting is built in and adjustable, and the timing
can be automatically retarded with boost or with NO2 activation.
Ignitech make a range of reasonably priced ignition-only controllers
that were originally designed for bike engines but are also ideal
for a competition Holden six. See the links section for details.
Timing is critical, as a starting point you could try about
12deg initial (for a mild engine) and about 30deg total and tune from there.
As the cam overlap is increased the amount of initial advance increases
also - it's not unusual for a street car with a biggish cam to want
20 degrees of initial. Race engines that aren't driven at low rpms will
often work very well with a locked distributor that provides a fixed amount
of advance at all rpms. With this you may need to use seperate starter and
ignition switches so that you can spin the engine up on the starter before
turning on the ignition. Don't
forget to verify that the marks on the balancer/timing case are
accurate before you start. Any street driven engine should be
equipped with vacuum advance - it has no effect on drag strip
performance but it will definitely help with fuel economy and
throttle response when cruising on part throttle. Even competition
engines can benefit from vacuum advance - it can help conserve fuel
while under the yellow.
An Ignitech programmable ignition controller. This drives individual coils and because there is no need for a distributor is ideal
for competition engines.

As for spark plugs, I don't have any experience with any of the fancy designs -
 the "normal" NGKs seem to work fine. For higher outputs you'll likely want to
go one or two steps cooler though most N/A engines won't need to go any further
down the heat range than that. For mild street engines a gap of around 0.055" will
be fine, but as the output and rpms rise you'll probably want to decrease
this to no more than 0.040". Some engines respond to "plug indexing" or orienting
the ground electrode in a certain position while others don't seem to care
which way they point. I haven't experimented with indexing plugs on the little
Holden; perhaps there are a few horses to be found.
There may be minor power gains to be had from running very high
output ignition systems, but if your present system is working well
then the improvements are likely to be tiny. Very high energy
systems allow the use of quite wide plug gaps that expose more of
the mixture to the hotter spark. This results in slightly quicker
combustion and a reduction in the amount of ignition advance
required. On a horsepower per dollar basis though, the benefits are
miniscule. With any high energy system the quality and routing of
the high-tension leads is critical.
