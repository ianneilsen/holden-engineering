## Nine Port Heads summary

While engines from other manufacturers of the same era had head
porting that was at least adequate or even too big (eg. Cleveland
or square port BB Chev), the 9 port Holden head was barely able to
feed stock 149 motors. The bigger, later motors were equally
asthmatic despite having bigger valves. Where other engines
responded well to intake, exhaust or especially cam upgrades, the
old Holdens never really woke up until the head was modified. The
intake ports in particular were abysmal, but on the positive side
even the most godawful butchery of the ports nearly always produced
an increase in power. Perfectune recognized an opportunity to
provide an exchange head with improved porting and bigger valves,
and sold squillions of their YellaTerra heads. The mods were basic
and mainly carried out on automatic machines, keeping the prices
low. Power and fuel economy could be substantially improved with
nothing more than a head upgrade. There are still a lot of these YT
heads around and on a mild performance engine they do a reasonable
job, with the so called "Bathurst" style heads capable of making
200 odd hp.

### Deep dive

Lets look more closely at the 9 port heads. The most obvious
feature is the siamese inlet ports, with the six cylinders grouped
into three pairs and each pair sharing an inlet port. The valves
are arranged like this: EI IE EI IE EI IE. Cylinders 1 and 2 share
an inlet port, as do 3,4 and 5,6. Traditionally siamese ports have
been considered unsuitable for high performance engines and in many
cases (eg. BMC 4's) there is good reason for this. However, in the
case of the Holden motor port sharing can hardly be blamed for the
heads poor performance. If we look at the centre two cylinders
(3&4) for example, we see they are 360deg apart in the firing
order, and even with the longest duration cam there is never a time
that both cylinders have their intake valves open at the same time.
So obviously there is no chance for one cylinder to rob it's
neighbour. The end pairs of cylinders are slightly different, and
there is a short period during each cycle where one intake is
closing while the other is starting to open. But this period is so
short (and occurs at a time when there is so little flow) that any
inter-cylinder influence will be negligible. It's not the fact that
the ports are siamesed that hurts the flow, it's the basic design
of the port along with that head bolt that passes through it.
The valves are all inline and only slightly canted and this,
combined with the fact that the ports are quite low, makes for a
sharp, almost right angled bend in the valve pocket area. Add to
this a cast iron pillar that runs up the centre of the port near
the gasket face and things are looking even worse. This pillar is
where the head retaining bolt passes through, and is quite thick,
almost a third of the port width. Over the years there have been
several approaches to solving the head bolt problem, the most
common being to cut the thick pillar out, replacing it with a
thinwall steel tube. This is what YellaTerra did, and it's quite
effective in increasing flow. Some people have cut the pillar out
and installed a socket head cap screw in the floor of the port to
clamp the head down, then screwed a flush fitting plug into the
hole in the port roof. I doubt that there is much difference in
flow either way, but the conventional steel tube approach is the
most convenient.

Nine port head from a red 202. Note the thick bolt boss in the intake port.
Fortunately there is a lot of meat in the port walls to work
with, and it's easy to get big increases in flow and power output.
If you're serious about making power, you should leave the port
work to someone with the experience and equipment to get good
results, and these people can get a 9 port head to flow enough to
make over 310hp. In fact, in terms of sheer bulk flow you'll
probably get more from a 9 port head than a 12 port, though of
course bulk flow is only part of the story.

### Valves

The standard valve sizes are too small, and you should aim to
use at least XU1 or VH/VK size valves. The centres are fairly
widely spaced, so there is plenty of room for bigger valves and
seats. The downside to this is that the valves are very badly
shrouded at the sides of the chamber, and it's pointless to try to
widen the chamber because the side walls already overhang the
cylinder walls. And anyway, there just isn't enough material
between the adjacent chambers to lay the walls back much and still
have sufficient thickness in between to support the head gasket. Of
course the shrouding becomes worse as the valve size is increased,
partially negating the benefits of using those big valves.
We'll talk about combustion chambers more after we look at the
12 port heads as they are pretty similar with both types of head.
If youre doing the head work yourself, all I can suggest is that
you resist the temptation to make the ports huge and concentrate on
slightly raising the roof of the ports, tapering them back from the
port face to the valve bowl, so in effect the angle under the valve
is less severe. Of course, you need to be able to match your intake
manifold. Larger valve seats will have to be blended in and the
bowl area can be opened up. The Holden ports are a bit unusual in
that they seem to flow best when the bowl area is pretty much
straight sided, and almost as big in diameter as the inside
diameter of the valve seat.Don't grind the port floor at all,
except to clean up any dags. There is no need for significant
widening on any reasonable street engine. The biggest gains will
come from fitting oversized valves, reducing the shrouding and from
reducing the width of the head bolt boss. It isn't strictly
necessary to cut it out and fit a steel tube, just narrow it and
streamline it.

The earlier engines had intake valves of about 1.49" in
diameter, and these are hopelessly undersized for nearly any
application. Later red 202s and 173s had 1.625" valves, but these
are still a bit small for anything but the smallest or mildest of
engines. For a high output application you really need an intake
valve of around 1.7" to 1.74" diameter. There's not much point
going beyond this because the shrouding just becomes too tight and
especially with the small chambers excessively big valves may
actually flow less. The YellaTerra heads generally used valves
3/16" oversize.

### Exhaust

Enlarged nine port intake with bolt boss and port divider removed. Either that or it's a two-car garage... Good flow; poor velocity.
The exhaust ports flow quite well by comparison, and again there
is plenty of meat to work with. There is a thick wall dividing the
centre four exhaust ports, and these also have a head bolt passing
through them. Unfortunately on some heads the wall doesn't quite
extend all the way to the gasket face so these ports are at least
partly interconnected, and I assume this would reduce the benefits
of using tube headers or extractors. As with the intake, resist the
temptation to go overboard with the grinder. Work out what size
primary pipe size you will be using on the exhaust and match the
port to this (keep it slightly smaller actually), trying to keep
the cross sectional area fairly constant. Ideally there will be a
step up of about 1 to 1.5mm all around the port into the exhaust
manifold flange. You will probably find you will remove little if
any wall material apart from a cleanup and some streamlining of the
guide boss. The 1.275" exhaust valves of the earlier engines will
be much too small, but you could get away with using stock 1.37"
valves in a mild engine, and 1.48" blue/black valves will be big
enough even in fairly highly tuned engines.


We can summarise the 9 port heads like this:

1. The standard head is extremely restrictive and won't make much
power no matter what other engine components you have.
2. Siamese ports might be less than ideal, but on the Holden 6 the
firing order makes flow robbing from port to port a non-issue.
3. An expert head porter can achieve massive flow increases, up to 300
odd hp, and even an amateur can get good results with care.
4. Oversize valves are necessary, but it's no use going overboard
because of the chamber shrouding.
5. There are many different types of manifold available for the 9
port, more than for the 12 port.
