Managing Torsional Vibrations
At high rpms, the Holden crank suffers from a fair bit
of torsional vibration of the crankshaft, though it's not as severe
as in some other straight sixes. For those not familiar with the phenomenon
a quick summary goes like this: the crank is being continually subjected to
impulsive forces from combustion and compression pressures as well as inertial
loadings from accelerating and deccelerating the reciprocating bits. These forces
vary in direction and magnitude and tend to make the crank motion somewhat jerky
rather than spinning at a constant speed. Now, the crank isn't perfectly rigid
and is somewhat restrained at one end by the flywheel and the load but is relatively
free at the front. Because of this there is some relative twisting forward and back
between the ends of the crank. Providing this isn't excessive it's not a problem
(say not much more than a degree or so). The thing is though the crank
(because of its springiness) has its own natural resonance or frequency that it
wants to vibrate at, a bit like a guitar string. And if the frequency of the
impulses fed into the crank match the natural resonating frequency of the crank
(or a multiple thereof) then things can get ugly. If left uncontrolled the amplitude
of the torsional vibrations will jump dramatically. This isn't just a gentle buzz either,
the vibrations can be violent enough to break the crank, or shear the flywheel
bolts or shake the rim off the balancer. At milder levels it can badly affect spark timing.
Incidentally, it's quite common for
straight six crankshafts to resonate at a frequency that corresponds with
6000 - 6500 rpm. Provided you can stay above or below these critical speeds
then vibration is usually negligible or at least manageable.
There are basically four things you can do to minimise torsional vibration problems:
1.Use lighter reciprocating components
2.Use a flywheel and balancer weight that shifts the crankshafts resonant frequency above or below the engines rev range
3.Use an effective harmonic balancer/damper
4.Use devices such as heavy main girdles and grout filling to minimise any sympathetic vibration of the block
Most of these are fairly self explanatory but it might pay to take a closer look at the second one. As we said earlier
the crank will have a natural resonant frequency, and this can be shifted up (by using a lighter flywheel and balancer)
or down (by using heavier components). It might seem counter-intuitive, but it's quite likely that a light flywheel and balancer
will be best on a relatively mild engine - it will help raise the troublesome rpm range above the engines normal operating range.
Conversely, heavy flywheels and balancers can help with a very high revving engine by shifting the resonant range below the engines
powerband - providing the engine can accelerate quickly through the resonant patch then vibration shouldn't be much of a problem.
I've recently spent a fair bit of time studying published information regarding torsional vibration
and different types of harmonic balancers. The idea was to gain an
understanding that would help me select a suitable harmonic balancer
for a somewhat oddball Holden six. Unfortunately there's not a lot of
test data out there; while the physics of torsional
vibration are well understood, there is little in the way of reliable
data related to the hardware needed to control it. Manufacturers data
often seems to be deliberately incomplete or misleading, and much of
the information related to practical control of TV is contradictory.
For what it's worth here are a few notes on
different styles of dampers and balancers:
Rubber bonded dampers (like the OEM style) are by far the most
popular. They consist of a heavy outer ring attached to a crank mounted
hub by a thin layer of rubber. They have a natural resonant frequency that
depends on the mass of the ring and the characteristics of the rubber.
Manufacturers claim that they are carefully tuned to match the particular
engine but this is not strictly accurate. All that's really
important is that the resonance of the balancer
doesn't
match the resonance
of the crank. Detractors claim bonded balancers are only effective at
a certain rev range but in reality they are fairly effective over a wide
range of speeds - excluding of course the speed that matches the balancers
own resonating frequency. Manufacturers publish graphs showing that these types outperform
other styles and as far as I'm aware these are the only type of balancer
available off-the-shelf for the little Holden.
Fluid damped units (eg. Fluidampr) again use a heavy ring, but this time
it's in a closely fitting steel shell that holds a heavy viscous silicone
fluid along with the ring. Viscous shear provides the damping action.
These units have no natural resonance of their own so I guess they would
eliminate the possibility of inadvertantly operating them in the "wrong"
speed range. They seem to be mildly effective over the entire range but
perhaps less effective than the other types at very high frequencies. Commonly
fitted as OEM on low speed/high amplitude applications such as large diesels
where they seem to perform exceptionally well.
Again, manufacturers publish graphs showing their product outperforming
the other types.
The ATI Super Damper combines features of both the above types. Like the
fluid damped units, they utilise a heavy ring within a close fitting shell. Instead
of floating in a viscous fluid though, these dampers have numerous rubber o-rings
encircling both the inner and outer diameters of the heavy ring. These o-rings fit
snugly into grooves machined into the ring and make the ring a light interference fit
into the steel balancer casing. Functionally then, they are an elastomeric type of damper
even though the construction is more like a typical fluid damper. They differ from
normal elastomeric dampers in a couple of ways. Firstly, the damper is fairly easy
to disassemble using normal hand tools. Secondly, the number and hardness of o-rings used
can be varied to help tune the damper to suit individual application. Because of these features
the ATI balancers can be rebuilt or retuned by the owner/tuner. There is no off-the shelf
ATI balancer for the little six, however ATI will make you a custom hub to suit on request,
and for an additional charge. They will also provide advice on what o-ring combination will
most likely suit the engine, so at least you would have a reasonable starting point. These
balancers are found on nearly all the high-end normally aspirated drag race engines in the US
eg. ProStock and enjoy an extremely good reputation amongst the professional teams.
Independent balancer tests are extremely rare, but the results of one test program I
have seen put the ATI units in first place, closely followed by the Rattler (described below)
then some premium elastomeric dampers (eg BHJ) and then finally the fluid dampers.
I think for the serious engine builder the ATI Super Damper would certainly be worth investigation.
ATI's Superdamper is almost ubiquitous in NHRA ProStock applications. They
enjoy a very good reputation and are constructed like a fluid damper but functionally they are
of the elastomeric variety. Custom hubs are available.
Pendulum type balancers have been used extensively on aircraft engines
for years, and an automotive unit using roughly the same priciple is available
in the TCI Rattler. Strictly speaking these are actually a puck type of balancer, though
TCI refer to them as pendulum balancers. The feature that distinguishes these units
from the others is that unlike the dampers, they don't actually absorb any energy
or create heat. Theoretically they should have a slight power advantage but whether it's
enough to be measurable is unclear.
This design uses a solid wheel which has had several (usually nine)
holes drilled through, close to the periphery. Steel rollers fit into each hole with
a certain amount of clearance and as the crank vibrates the rollers are displaced
within the holes to a different position. The mass of the rollers looks quite
small compared to the pendulums in the aircraft engines though having said
that the Rattler does seem to enjoy a fairly good reputation. There is no
natural resonance with these balancers and they are said to be effective
over the entire range. TCI publishes graphs showing (surprise, surprise)
the Rattler outperforming the other types.
Pointless picture of TCIs "Rattler". You can't see the rollers
in this shot but just look at that cool rattlesnake!
If you plan on frequently
running high revs - say 6000rpm plus - then it's important to get
a suitable balancer on the front of the crank, and this will very
likely be bigger and heavier than the stocker.
Romac make some fairly big competition balancers for the six - as to their
effectiveness I don't know for certain. Fluid filled dampers from
Perkins diesels have been used very successfully in the past though
I doubt if the original designers of these ever intended them to
see very high speeds. Another alternative is to adapt steel
competition dampers made for larger engines, eg. Chev V8s. The
damper rim/rubber ring combination on these style units is
supposedly tuned to suit specific applications, but the important
thing I think is getting a unit with sufficient mass. And you could
probably argue that a Holden 6 at 8000rpm would be producing
torsional vibrations at a similar frequency to a Chev V8 at 6000rpm
anyway. Adapting a fluid or pendulum type balancer from another engine
would sidestep the potential tuning problem and may be a safer option.
Finding the space to accomodate a big balancer might not be
easy, but if you're turning big revs then you really have no
choice.
A steel flywheel is also a necessity if you'll be running higher
rpms, say 6000 plus. You might get away with the cast wheel but for
the price of a steel one it's just not worth the risk. As we mentioned
earlier, flywheel mass can be used to shift the cranks resonant frequency
up or down, and if vibration is a problem then this should take precedence
over other considerations. If torsional vibration isn't excessive though,
flywheel weight can be used as a tuning tool. Cars with a very high power to weight ratio
will benefit from the lightest possible flywheel, while at the
other end of the scale it could pay to use plenty of flywheel
weight with a heavy, modestly powered car. Full bodied sedans built
for drags that aren't traction-limited (and that would be most n/a
sixes) will usually run quicker with a lot of flywheel mass. The
heavy wheel will help get the car off the line and may more than
make up for the slight drop in acceleration.
Retaining the flywheel
Torsional vibration
also manifests itself at the flywheel end, most commonly by continually
loosening the flywheel bolts and/or buckling the clutch straps. Loose flywheels
can be a chronic problem with a high revving six if the correct procedure isn't followed.
The first thing to do is check that the faces on both the flywheel and the crank flange
are perfectly smooth and flat. You can check this with bearing blue, and if there is
insufficient contact area, or any signs of galling or other damage then some machining is
in order. Recheck with blue after any machining has been done to verify that the fit is now acceptable.
Also check that the flywheel spigots snugly onto the crank and replace parts as required.
The reason that the bolts become loose (even if they've been loctited or wired) is that the
torsional shaking causes movement between the crank flange and the flywheel - the bolts only clamp
the wheel on; they do nothing to key it to the crank. To positively locate it we need to dowel the wheel to the crank.
The later engines used a single dowel and this is sufficient for moderate rpms, but as a minimum
on a competition engine you should use two hardened dowels and a
set of very high strength bolts (the ARP kit for a BMC Mini fits). The dowels need to be quite a tight fit - if
you can fit and remove the wheel by hand they are much too loose.
Fitting the bolts also requires a bit
of extra attention. Make sure the thread and under-head areas are lubed with moly grease before fitting, then
torque them up, back them off and retorque them until they consistently seat at the same position every time.
This may take five or six goes to achieve, but if you neglect this step then loose bolts are very likely.
Loctite isn't necessary, but if you
must
loctite them then carry out the above procedure first, then mark
the head of the bolts and the flywheel so you can maintain the correct orientation. Remove the bolts one at a time
and thoroughly clean the moly from the threads using solvent and air. Loctite the thread and tighten it until the
marks line up. ARP stipulate that no washers be used, though with an alloy flywheel I'd be tempted to use grade 8
washers along with the torqueing procedure above.
Getting back to flywheel weights for a minute; YellaTerra make steel flywheels
in stock, lightweight and ultra lightweight versions. My own preference for a naturally
aspirated sedan is the stock weight wheel. There is little to no performance
penalty and it seems to help manage the vibration issue. Be very very cautious
about using an ultra-light flywheel! Using these can lead to clutch and driveline
failures, especially when coupled with a heavy front balancer. The stock weight
flywheel is nearly always my first choice.
