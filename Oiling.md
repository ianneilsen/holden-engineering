Oiling and Oil Pumps
The stock Holden system is simple and relatively trouble free on
a stock or mild engine, but could use some help with high rpms and
high hp. The Holden, like nearly all engines, has a bit of a
problem supplying an appropriate amount of oil over a wide range of
speeds. Increases in the crank speed do lead to a slight increase
in oil requirements due to the increased throw-off, but its nowhere
near the increase in oil flow provided by the pump as revs
increase. The net result is less-than-ideal flow and pressure at
low speeds but too much at high speeds. Depending on the oil viscosity
and the bearing clearances it will take anywhere from 20 to 30 litres
per minute to oil the little six. The standard size oil pump can supply
this and so
should be sufficient for nearly any high performance engine, and
the only application I can think of where a high volume pump might
be useful is an engine that runs at unusually low speeds and high
loads; a turbo engine perhaps. It's surprising how much power is
absorbed by an oil pump, and if you've ever primed a Chev with a
power drill and dummy distributor you'll have experienced it first
hand. Whenever there is an excess capacity the unused oil blows
over the relief valve, and the energy that goes into this work is
converted into heat. In other words it makes the oil hotter, and
this is another reason to avoid the high volume pumps.
It's worth remembering these motors are pretty long in the tooth
so you'd want to check out any used pump carefully before using it
again. Check the clearance between the tips of the gear teeth and
the pump body and reject any pump with more than a few thou
clearance. Also check the end clearance and keep it down to about 2
thou. Backlash between the gears isn't really critical but check
for badly worn or scored gears, or worn shafts and bushings. If
there is any doubt about a used pumps condition it's best to
replace it.
Higher speeds and looser bearing clearances - both of which are
typical for a high performance engine - will require higher volumes
of oil. The standard pump will handle this, but the stock suction
too small to ensure an adequate supply. The standard
suction line is made from 1/2" steel tube, with an I.D. of about
7/16". If you want to retain the factory suction arrangement (and
it's perfectly fine with a factory style sump) it pays to enlarge
it a little. There's no need to go overboard, flow capacity is
proportional to the square of the tube diameter so even a small
increase in tube size will help substantially. A 5/8" tube will
work, but remember to also open up the fitting and the
drilling in the block that leads to the pump. The stock pickup can
be reused with the bigger tube; it may pay to slightly flare the
end that is attached to the pickup to ease the entry into the tube,
like a little bellmouth. Don't forget to reattach the support brace
to prevent the tube from cracking. Your local hydraulics supplier
should be able to provide the tubing and fittings.
The other way to upgrade the suction line is to use an external
line, and this is the approach commonly used with so-called
competition sumps. The original suction line is plugged and a hole
drilled in the appropriate spot towards the front of the pump cover
plate. A threaded adaptor is silver soldered to the plate and a
hose run from this to the sump. Using this method means you can
make the suction line as big as you like, but 5/8" to 3/4" I.D.
should be plenty for any application. Again, you need to maintain
this dimension all the way from the pickup to the pump port. There
is really no need to use those gay looking anodised fittings and
stainless braided hose - the appropriate stuff from your local
hydraulic hose shop is at least as good. It's important to reface
the cover plate after attaching the adaptor to address any minor
distortion that may have occurred.
Typical 3/4" external suction line.
A short passage, about 7/16" diameter and a few inches long runs
from the oil pump and intersects the main oil gallery just behind
the no. 4 main. The main gallery is about 9/16" in diameter and
runs the full length of the block. From the main gallery to the mains
are 1/4" drillings to oil the main bearings. Mains 1,3,5 and 7 have
additional 11/64" holes leading from the mains back to the cam bearings.
No. 1 main also has an additional hole that leads to the cam gear nozzle.
Opening up the passages to 1,3,5 and 7 is good insurance against
the cam bearings bleeding too much oil from these bearings.
The main oil gallery intersects the lifter bores, so check that
none of these bores are worn otherwise you'll be bleeding off oil
before it gets to the crank. Years ago some builders ran external
lines to the end bearings but if you don't run excessively thick
oil or excessive bearing clearance, drill the passages to the odd
numbered mains and you have sufficient pressure this is unnecessary. I can't
stress enough the importance of keeping the viscosity down and also
of not loading the engine until the oil has warmed up. I've seen
several cranks/bearings that have been burnt simply because the
too-thick oil that was used didn't flow quickly enough. On the
other hand I've also seen other engines where the oil has been
thinned dramatically (through fuel dilution) where the bearings
have survived nicely.
Basically all you need to do for the bearings to survive is this:
1, Use a pump suction line of at least 5/8" and open up the passage to the pump
2, Use a die grinder to blend the passages between the pump and block
3, Drill the passage from the pump to the main gallery from 7/16" to 1/2"
4, Drill the passages from the main gallery to the odd numbered mains from 1/4" to 9/32"
5, Shim the relief valve to approx. 65psi.
Naturally all the oilways in the block and crank will have to be
thoroughly cleaned, and if you avoid excessively loose bearing
clearances you should have no trouble maintaining enough oil
pressure. Two to three thou should be enough to ensure a reasonable
flow across the bearings, but not so loose as to drop the pressure
too much at lower speeds. Most lifters have a 3/32" oil feed hole; if
there is too much flow to the top end the hole can be filled with low
melting point silver solder and redrilled. This method should be more
reliable than the old "pipe cleaners in the pushrods method".
Of course all this work will be for nothing if the oil pump pickup
becomes uncovered, even if only for a second. The primary objective of
any oiling system will always be to provide a constant, uninterupted
flow of oil. Do whatever is necessary to build or buy an oil pan that
will suit the intended use of the car. Under full load the bearings
can be burnt in a painfully short time without oil - picking up a momentary
bubble of air may damage the engine in a time period too short for
the oil pressure gauge to react. This is one thing you absolutely
must
get right.

Choose your oil carefully and be aware that nearly all modern
petrol engine oils will be unsuitable for a high-output Holden
straight six. I won't go into viscosities and bearing clearances here
as thats covered in detail in another section. For the moment I'll just say
that the viscosity, operating temp and bearing clearance should all be compatible.
Unfortunately you can't find out much about an oil
just by reading the container - even the SAE viscosity numbers
cover such a wide range to be almost useless. An example of this is
an oil marketed as say SAE30 that is at the high end of the 30
range. This oil may actually be more viscous than another oil at
the low end of the 40 range that's marketed as an SAE40. It pays to
check the makers Technical Data Sheets where you will find accurate
specs on the viscosity at various temperatures as well as other
info. While we're on the subject, viscosities really have little
relation to an oils lubrication abilities so there is no point in
running a thick oil, the increased drag just robs power. Generally
if the bearing clearances are compatible with the oil viscosity you'll
have no trouble at all maintaining adequate pressure with a stock pump.
Oil manufacturers rarely state whether the product contains zinc on their label. This one from Pennzoil is an exception.
For those running a flat tappet cam - and this will be nearly
everyone - look for an oil that contains zinc dithiophosphate
(ZnDTP). Almost none of the modern petrol engine oils and only some
modern diesel oils have it, the reason being modern roller cammed
engines don't need it and also because it tends to foul catalytic
convertors and oxygen sensors. You mightn't find the ZnDTP level
mentioned in the tech data sheets but it will probably be in the
Material Safety Data Sheets. More than likely you will end up using
an oil designed primarily for diesel engines (eg. Rimula Super) and
these generally work very well. Just don't put it in a very high
mileage engine that hasn't previously been using diesel oil. The
high detergent levels will quickly loosen up the accumulated crud
in the engine with unpleasant results. For competition use there are
quite a few racing oils (eg. Valvoline) that have high zinc levels, and
these are even better than the diesel oils in high rpm applications.
The reason for this is that the high detergent levels in the diesel
oil tends to partly counteract the zinc compounds - the zinc is trying
to attach itself to the load bearing surfaces while the detergent is trying
to remove it. For any reasonable valve spring pressure the diesel oil
will be fine but for high rpm, heavily sprung engines a dedicated high-zinc
racing oil will be safer.
What about synthetics? I'm a big fan of these as it's possible to pick
up quite a few horsepower. They are especially good for drag race engines
as they allow the engine to be run quite cold and yet still have a reasonable
amount of oil flow.
There are a couple of things to watch out
for though. Firstly, make sure you use a mineral oil to break in the cam
and bed the rings, and be 100% certain that the rings are fully bedded
in before switching to synthetic. Also make sure the bearing clearances
are suitable for the thinner synthetic oil - more details on this in
the next section.
As for filtration, the stock setup is fine. Just be aware that
many replacement filters are of exceptionally poor quality, and
this includes the "performance" brands. A good choice is the
Baldwin B9; a Fleetguard LF3538 would also be acceptable. Also be
aware that many remote filter adaptors are quite restrictive so
check them carefully before use.
