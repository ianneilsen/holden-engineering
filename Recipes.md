Here are a few recipes you might find interesting:
The Poverty Pack
This is just a complete VK EFI 202 lifted from a Commodore. Often
you can buy the whole car as cheaply as just the motor. When you've
taken the motor out sell the wheels and some of the panels then
leave it in the front yard as a conversation piece. Your missus
will love it. Works well with LPG.
The Pov-Pak Plus
This one is a variation of the one above.
It's very very hard to beat this on a hp per dollar basis
and is great for a daily driver.
Start with a complete VK EFI engine. This package gives you a good
head, crank, rods and dissie all for a few hundred bucks. Freshen it
up if necessary and cut 0.040" from the head, or whatever it takes to
get up around 10:1. Whack a Tighe 310 or similar in it, and a set of
ebay extractors. Grab a Varajet manifold and hack the top out of it
before bolting on an adaptor and a Falcon Weber. Clean up the manifold
ports if you can. Enjoy good performance for less than $1500.
