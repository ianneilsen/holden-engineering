Reducing Friction and other losses
One of the major factors that contribute to the better mileage
and performance of current engine designs is the reduction of friction.
At high rpms especially, older engines like our little Holdens burn up
a lot of horsepower in overcoming internal friction. Fortunately though,
some of the friction-reducing techniques used by modern designs can be
applied to our straight sixes. There's a useful amount to be gained; it's
certainly not unreasonable to expect 20 to 30 hp at high rpms.
The specific areas we'll be looking at are:
oil rings
compression rings
pistons
valvetrain - mainly the lifter-to-lobe interface
special coatings
accessories
There are many more point of friction in an engine of course, but
these few are where the gains are most easily made. You can get a rough idea
of before-and-after drag levels by measuring the torque required to turn
the crank (plugs out of course) with a torque wrench. The torque required to
maintain rotation will be more meaningful than the breakaway torque, though it's a bit
hard to get a consistent reading sometimes.
We'll start with the piston rings, the components with the greatest potential for
improvement. There are two ways by which we can reduce ring drag: firstly by using rings
with a smaller cross-sectional height and secondly by using rings with less radial tension.
Either or both methods can be used but the first one is the most attractive.Thin 1mm rings
will have a fraction of the drag of old-school 2mm rings, but just as importantly the reduction
in drag isn't at the expense of oil control. An added advantage is that the lower mass of a thin
ring allows more rpms before ring flutter becomes a problem. Reducing the radial tension will
also reduce drag but it will also compromise oil control, so to find the optimum ring package
may take some amount of testing.
An easy way to measure the drag of each individual ring
is to fit the ring to a piston and then use a simple spring scale to measure the force
needed to slide the piston through the bore. Low-tension rings are readily available in the
common sizes, but really they are just file-to-fit rings made for a slightly smaller bore size.
So for a 0.040" oversize 202 you might experiment with file-back 0.020" compression rings.
You may be tempted to try rings with less radial thickness; they will certainly have less tension
for a given material but you really need custom pistons with shallower ring grooves to match the rings.
Excessively deep grooves may prevent the rings from loading quickly enough at high revs.
For the oil rings the approach is slightly different; use the "correct" ring rails for your
bore size but try undersize or modified expanders to reduce the drag. Expanders can be trimmed
or carefully squeezed with long-nosed pliers to reduce the preload. Obviously there are
limits to how far you can reduce ring tension, mainly depending on the intended use of the engine.
For an engine purely for drag racing you can reduce the tension quite a lot without problems,
especially if the pistons are gas ported. For circuit racing or other applications where
there is some closed throttle running you'd need a bit more tension to keep oil out of the chambers,
but still worthwhile gains are possible. For street use though there's a fine line between
a free-running engine and a smoky oil burner, so be conservative.
There are also gains to be made by using pistons with smaller skirt areas, but I'm a bit wary
of using much smaller skirts with Holden sixes. The reason for this is the relatively flimsy cylinder
walls, especially with an overbored 186 or 202. Smaller skirts will push the walls around more, and
impact on ring sealing and durability. So while there may be small improvements possible friction-wise,
I prefer to stick with pistons with full skirts more typical of production engines.
Typical slipper type pistons.The small skirts can reduce drag but may be counterproductive
with the flimsy 202/186 cylinder walls.
Now for the valvetrain: the two main areas where improvements may be made are the lifters and
the rocker arms. Nearly all reasonably modern pushrod engines use roller lifters, not for the
increased rates of lift that these make possible but because of the reduction in friction compared
to flat tappets. The higher the spring loads the greater the potential gains. The gains aren't anywhere
near what can be had from a low-tension ring package but they are significant nonetheless.
As for the rocker arms, again the potential gains will be in proportion to the lift, spring rates and
rpms used. For a mild engine using moderate springs and rpms the gains will be negligible
but on a high rpm race engine there will be a measurable improvement with roller rockers over the standard
stamped units.
I'm not convinced that there is any real need for special coatings on things
like engine bearings and so on. And where these have been shown to be beneficial
I think all that it proves is that the engine in question had marginal oiling.
The one exception would be coated piston skirts. Coated skirts are now commonplace
in many OEM applications as well as with aftermarket pistons. They show a measurable
improvement with the boundary-layer lubrication conditions of a cylinder wall/piston skirt
interface. If it's an option with your particular pistons I'd certainly consider it.
Many aftermarket and OEM pistons now have coated skirts to reduce friction.
Most engines will have to drive some accessories; typically the oil and water pumps,
alternator, fan and perhaps a power steering pump. The oil pump can't very well be deleted
but it certainly shoudn't be any bigger than is necessary. For drag racing the water pump
can often be omitted altogether, or perhaps an electric unit can be used and only switched
on after crossing the line. For circuit racing a stock-type mechanical pump will probably be best
but by altering the pulley sizes it could be slowed down by 30% or more to minimise losses.
Fans can take a lot of power to drive, and wherever possible the fan should be removed altogether.
If necessary an electric fan can be run as required.
Drag racers will most likely not need an alternator at all, so long as the battery can be topped
up between runs. Where an alternator must be run it can be an advantage to change the pulley
to reduce the alternator rpm. This won't decrease the load at all but it does help the alternator
survive high rpms and will reduce the inertia loading very slightly as the engine accelerates.
Something else to keep in mind with alternator equipped vehicles is the total electrical load.
It's obviously pointless to use electrically powered accessories such as fuel and water pumps, fans etc.
in an attempt to reduce losses if all we are doing is shifting the load onto the alternator.
A heavily loaded alternator can take a significant amount of power to drive, so anything we can do to reduce
its burden will pay off with more usable horsepower. For example, we wouldn't use grossly oversized
fuel pumps (it's surprising how often this is done) or an ignition system more suited to a top fuel engine.
When efficiency losses are taken into account every 30 - 40amps take about 1 hp to produce, and it's surprising
how quickly those amps can add up. Sometimes a couple of horsepower is the difference between a win and a loss.
