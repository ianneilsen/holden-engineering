Cam Selection
Selecting a cam profile has traditionally been a bit mysterious
to many builders, a bit hit-or-miss even. Most experienced builders
and cam grinders will be able to choose a profile that's very close
to the optimum, and there are some software packages that will help
as well. But in general, solid and reliable formula for calculating
a suitable cam profile has been somewhat lacking.
David Vizard has come up with a fairly simple procedure for systematically
selecting a cam. It's a bit unusual, but if you work backwards using combinations
that are known to work well his system seems quite credible. And anyway,
it's very hard to argue with someone who has been such an outstandingly successful
engine builder and developer. I'll briefly outline his method in the paragraphs
below, but if you want more detail you'll have to either buy his books or attend
his seminars. One thing that distinguishes Vizards methods from many of
the others is his belief that the overlap period is absolutely critical,
perhaps more so than any of the other valve events - as a result it forms
the foundation of cam selection.
The first step in the Vizard method is to select the overlap figure,
based on the engines rev range and it's low-lift flow characteristics.
For Holden headed engines with appropriately sized valves you could
work with these figures:
Around 45 degrees for mild street engines up to say 150hp
Around 55-65 degrees for mild engines up to around 180hp
Around 75 - 85 degrees for engines of up to roughly 220hp
And finally around 90 to 110 degrees or more for engines of 250hp and upwards
The next step is to calculate the LSA or lobe separation angle. Again,
this is based mainly on the low lift flow characteristics of the head.
For any Holden-headed engine with an intake valve of around 1.75" to 1.8"
(and this would be typical of most performance builds) then the starting
point will be around 106 to 109 degrees. Again, this ties in well with
real world results. This number assumes a reasonably aggressive flat
tappet cam and a compression ratio of between 9.5 and 10.5 to one.
For each point of compression above 10.5:1 add about 0.75 degrees to
the LSA. So for a 12.5:1 engine with a quick opening ramp you'd run about
110 degrees. And for less aggressive profiles (and this would include
many of the traditional Holden six profiles) you'd want to go the
other way, subtracting a degree or three from the LSA. For the majority
of competition engines running a "modern" profile though, 108 to 109 degrees
will be very close to the optimum.
Now it's time to determine the duration. Assuming we have already
worked out the overlap and LSA numbers we can simply add half the overlap
to the LSA and then multiply by two. For example, let's say we are building
a street and strip engine. We halve the overlap and get 30 degrees. Adding
this to our LSA of 109 degrees we get 139 degrees. Doubling this gives us
278 degrees, the "advertised" duration of our cam.
Lets look at another example, a 260hp, 13:1 race engine. Working on a
90 degree overlap and 110 deg. LSA we get (45+110)x2=310 degrees.
What about lift? Generally speaking, it will be hard to get to the point
where you have too much lift. In other words you'll probably find you come
up against practical limitations before the engine stops responding to further
increases. For mild street engines you'll most likely end up with around
0.450" or so, while higher-end competition engines will keep responding with
more power as the lift is increased up to 0.650" and beyond. Very high lifts
aren't always easy to achieve however, and will require some compromises to
be made with regard to rocker ratios and base circle diameters. Earlier I mentioned
the small cam journal diameter; this limits how "big" we can make the lobes
and still be able to slide it into the block. We can get around this to some
extent by reducing the base circle diameter and/or increasing the rocker ratio.
The trouble is, both these changes increase the stress on the camshaft
and there are limits to how small you can make the base circle without
making the shaft ridiculously fragile. I don't know what this lower limit
is exactly, but suspect for most engines to maintain reliability it will be around 0.9" to 0.950". Assuming
a journal diameter of around 1.75" and a 0.950" base circle, we get a maximum
theoretical lift of 0.580" with a 1.5:1 rocker, 0.620" with 1.6:1 and 0.680"
with a 1.75:1 rocker. The other limiting factors may be physical clearance
issues such as piston to valve.
Single or dual pattern? We touched on this in the porting section but
generally only the very low-end street engines will want a dual pattern
cam with a few more degrees of exhaust duration. Most engines with a reasonable
intake to exhaust flow ratio will be fine with a simple single pattern cam.
High-compression engines with with a high percentage of exhaust flow (pretty
common with ported Holden heads) may even prefer a reverse pattern grind
with a few degrees less on the exhaust lobes.
Now for some specific recommendations (and incidentally I don't recommend any
one particular cam company. I just list these ones because I have the specs. at hand).
Notice I don't list much for balls-out racers. For these application I think you really
need to look beyond off-the-shelf cams and spend some time talking with good grinders.
The information above may provide some guidance though.
OK, we'll start by looking at something for a mild street car of around 150ish horsepower - you might want to try a Tighe 640T, or a Wade 104.
For a slightly warmer engine of roughly 180hp check out a Camtech 663, Crow 35626 or Tighe 1029
Up to the low 200s we'd look at a Camtech 629A-106, Tighe 764R or Crow 35647
For hp in the mid 200s and over a Camtech 629B-106 or Tighe 389 would be worth considering.
These recommendations should get you in the ballpark for a dual-purpose car but again,
if it's a full on racer your best bet would be to consult the cam grinder; he'll be able
to recommend something based on your flow figures etc. and more than likely it will give better
results than a generic off-the-shelf cam.
