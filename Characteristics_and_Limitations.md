How To Build A High-Performance Holden Six
Building the hot holden six

Characteristics and Limitations
In it's day the little Holden was an exceptionally lightweight
engine, and even compared to modern sixes with their more widespread
use of light alloys the Holdens weight is still quite competitive.
Compared to an iron V8 it's very light and compact, and can provide
reasonable performance in a lightish car
like an early Holden or Torana. Having said that, the red motor
wasn't a particularly advanced design even when it was first
released and it's ultimately quite limited in output, mainly by the
cylinder head design. As we will see later, the cylinder head is
the key to making power with the six. The other limiting factor
with regard to power production is block durability. While they can
handle as much as double the original horsepower without problems,
further increases frequently result in a cracked or broken block,
particularly when high rpms are used. Blown engines can easily make
more power than the engine can reliably withstand - with enough
boost power levels of over 600hp are possible if not sustainable.
Turbocharging works exceptionally well on these engines; making 400
odd hp is easy, not only that but the power is made at rpm levels
below those that cause block problems.
Chev six from the mid 50s. Chev influence on Holdens design is obvious.
Naturally aspirated, don't expect to get much more than around
220 - 230hp for a streetable engine. This mightn't sound like a lot
compared to todays injected V8s, but it's not unusual for a light
street car with a hot six to get into the 13s without resorting to
nitrous. With exceptionally light cars like the early Toranas 12s
are fairly easily achievable but the streetability of such an
engine will be marginal. Its possible - if not easy - to get 300+
hp from these engines using radically ported 9 port heads and
matching cam profiles, but at these levels the powerband is
painfully narrow and the engine will be starting to become fragile.
If you really do need much more than say 240hp from a Holden 6, it
may prove more practical and cheaper in the long run to use a
Jzed/Duggan style head. Not only will you get the peak horsepower,
you'll get a wider powerband.
Why - Or Why Not - A Holden Six
I'll be blunt. If performance is the primary consideration and
you don't have to use a particular engine to comply with rules then
there are much better choices than the old Holden. Modern engines
from Nissan or Toyota for example will out perform the old Aussie
six by a massive margin - you won't even be in the race. Another
older engine with a fair bit more potential - mainly due to it's
bigger displacement - is the old Hemi six. All of these engines
will outperform the Holden and almost certainly cost less on a
horsepower per dollar basis. Building Holden sixes with outputs
of around 250hp and up can get very expensive very quickly. Unless you
really need or want to run the six then something like an LSX, a 2JZ or an RBDET
will make more power for less money. If however, you don't need to make a
million horsepower, or you'll be competing against similar engines,
or perhaps you want to build up a cool old-school street car then
the Holden six might do the job nicely. Of course, some of us just have
a soft spot for the little sixes and enjoy the challenges of making them
perform. Just don't kid yourself
that you're going to show these young blokes with their turboed
2JZs a thing or two with the old 202 - you'll only embarass
yourself.
