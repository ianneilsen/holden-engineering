A guide to the high-performance red, blue and
black straight sixes..

These pages are an attempt to provide some information and guidance
for those wanting to build a higher output six cylinder Holden
engine - specifically the red, blue or black straight sixes. They are
based on my own admittedly limited experience with these engines,
plus what I've been able to glean from others. Reliable information
for these old engines isn't easily available, and as usual anything
you read in magazines should be taken with a big grain of salt -
after all their primary responsibility is to their advertisers. Given
the age of these engines though, it's rare to find them mentioned in
magazines anymore.
The various internet forums are probably the primary source of information
for Holden six builders these days, and it was the standard of information
on these forums that motivated me to write these notes in the first place.
To put it bluntly, I'd estimate at least 80% of the information on the forums is
either outdated, wildly inaccurate or just horribly wrong. And I don't just mean
wrong as in difference-of-opinion-wrong, but provably, demonstrably, against-the-laws-of-physics
wrong. There's no security in numbers either; it's not uncommon for a query
to be answered by several people all giving similar - but erroneous - advice.
Bottom line: be very very wary of any advice read on an internet forum.
Some forums will have a small handful of members that are quite knowledgeable
and willing to share their knowledge while the vast majority of members
will continue to recycle the same old drivel. If you lurk around a forum for a while
you will work out which members to listen to and which ones to ignore. Unfortunately though
there are some forums that simply don't have
anyone
posting anything useful.
Basically then, don't take anything you hear or read as gospel, and
use common sense and carefully consider anything you read.
Of course, that applies to what I've written here.
You'll notice that the information here isn't particularly
detailed; it's more of an attempt to steer the reader in the right
direction. You'll also notice that I tend to mix metric and
imperial units - you'll just have to convert them yourself if
that's a problem.
Naturally, a site like this can never be complete, and I don't pretend
for a millisecond that it is 100% accurate. For this reason I welcome
suggestions and corrections. It's aimed at the builder with a
limited budget, and is therefore focused on using the original
Holden major components - eg. block/crank/head. Mainly we will
discuss naturally aspirated engines, though we may touch briefly on
issues related to blown engines.
This site is updated semi-regularly, so you may want to check
from time to time. Some people like to have a copy to read offline
or print; there
is a
zipped archive here
for you to download the whole thing in one hit.
