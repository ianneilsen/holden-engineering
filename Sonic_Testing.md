How To Build A High-Performance Holden Six

Sonic Testing
For reasons I don't fully understand, the little Holden engine seems
to require bore walls a fair bit thicker than what would normally be needed
in other engines. And if the walls aren't thick enough relative to the output
then all sorts of problems crop up ranging from bore splitting to poor ring seal and
excessive blowby. Checking the thickness of the cylinder walls should be one of the
first steps taken when qualifying a block for use in a high-output engine.
Many years ago the equipment to test material thickness was either non-existent or
prohibitively expensive, but now of course ultrasonic testers are both very easily available
and as cheap as chips. What this means is that the home builder of Holden sixes can and should
have his own sonic testing gear to assist with selecting a satisfactory block. So far so good -
the ebay testers are cheap and easy to use, but accurate readings don't come automatically.
Without some preparation work, the readings are almost certainly going to be erroneous. Worse,
the errors will most likely be in the wrong direction (they'll lead you to think that the walls are thicker
than they really are) and the readings probably won't be so obviously bogus as to alert you
to the fact there is a problem. That's what this page is about then, trying to help the new user
get  meaningful readings from the tester.
The first thing to do is set the tester to match the properties of the material being tested. This
is done by adjusting the "velocity" setting. The instruments generally have a range of preset
velocities to choose from, corresponding with various materials. You would expect the generic "steel/iron"
setting to be fairly close but in my experience it's quite a bit too high to give readings that are even remotely
accurate with the iron Holden blocks. So what we need to do is measure a section of the block with micrometers
or vernier calipers and compare the measurement with the reading from the sonic tester. I like to use front
face of the block, at about the 5 oclock position of the water pump opening. It's easy to access this spot with
a micrometer, and the thickness here approximates the cylinder wall thickness. Different testers may have slightly
different adjustments but the instruction book will show how to adjust the velocities until the reading from the
sonic tester matches that of the micrometer. If you have some larger micrometers (say 3"-4") or verniers you should
also be able to get a measurement of the front wall of no. 1 cylinder by measuring through the water pump
opening. You may need to use a ball bearing on the cylinder side to allow the flat anvil to work with the concave
cylinder wall, and a spacer on the other side but with a little maths you can get quite an accurate measurement. 
This gives us another figure against which to verify our sonic measurements.
Now that we have the tester calibrated to match our block material, we're almost ready to start testing some bores.
But first we need to make sure the surface of the probe matches the curvature of the cylinders. The probe
must
fit the surface being tested accurately, without any rocking or visible gaps. You can't just fill the gaps with gel
and expect meaningful results - the tester may show the coupled icon and the readings may be stable but the numbers
will almost certainly be bogus. The easiest way to trim the probe is to hold some wet-and-dry paper against the bore
wall and then run the probe on this to sand it to shape. If you look at the face of the probe it will have two halves
with a divider in between - sand the face so that the divider runs along the high part of the curve. You'll want to
sand the probe until you have a very good match against the wall without
any rocking. Obviously if you'll be testing different size bores you'll want several probes to suit, and possibly one
for flat surfaces. Once you have the probe properly shaped you can start checking the bore wall thicknesses. The first
test should be the front wall of number one, and the reading should match the measurement you got using mikes or verniers
on the same spot. If it doesn't, stop and work out why before going any further.
Test each cylinder in at least 3 posotions on the thrust (cam side) wall, the non-thrust side, and both front and back walls.
You may be surprised to see how much variation there is from side to side and from front to back. Number one might be
significantly thicker on the thrust side, but by the time you get to number six it could be the other way around. This
variation as a result of core shift isn't always a bad thing though - a little left to right shift can give a bit of extra thickness
on the thrust side where it's needed most.
Another thing to watch out for is the gel or coupling paste that is used. There are gels made specifically for the
purpose and most likely the tester will come with a small tube supplied. This stuff works fine, but it is water based
and corrosive. If you test some bores and don't wipe off the goo, the walls will have rust spots there within a couple of days.
Yeah, I learned this the hard way. Provided the probe is a good match to the surface nearly any heavyish oil or light
grease will work just as well and won't rust the surface. I like Vaseline; it's not too messy and it's not corrosive. If
you use grease avoid moly based stuff on finished bores - you probably don't want moly rubbed into the crosshatch. Not only
that, it makes a mess.
Ultrasonic thickness testers are readily available and are
affordable even for the casual builder. When you get your tester get a couple of
extra probes - these can be profiled to measure curved surfaces such as cylinder
bores and port walls.
Now that we have our tester set up so that we have some confidence in it's readings, what sort of numbers
are we looking for? This will be a matter of opinion to some extent but I can give you some rough guidelines based on
the wall thicknesses of engines that have (or haven't!) performed reliably in use. The numbers will vary of course depending
and the output of the engine, and yes, I'm aware that they are a lot more than what you'd look for in say a smallblock Chev or Ford.
For a very mild street engine of not much more than say 150-160hp, I'd like to see at around 0.170" or more on the thrust side,
0.150" or so on the left side and 0.1" front and rear. Any block without too much core shift will meet this, even at 0.060" over.
For warmer engines of say 160 to 220hp you wouldn't want much less than 0.190 - 0.2" on the thrust, 0.165 - 0.175" on the left side
and 0.110 - 0.120" front and rear.
For balls-out efforts of 220hp to 300hp and over you really want all the thickness you can get, preferably 0.250" on the thrust, 0.190" on the
left side and 0.140" or so on the front and rear. You'd have to be very lucky to get these numbers from even a virgin bore 202, but they'll
be pretty easy with a blue 2.8 block.
Now remember these numbers are just a rough guide and really just opinion formed on the basis of what's worked in the past. And again,
they are a lot thicker than the minimums commonly used with other engines. But for whatever reasons, the little Holden really seems to
need the extra material to both perform and survive.
