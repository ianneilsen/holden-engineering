Vibration Related Problems
At mild levels of tune the little Holden is quite a smooth-running engine.
At higher outputs and rpms however, it suffers from some severe vibration-related
problems and failure modes. These are related to two very distinct and different
phenomena. These two types are often completely confused in the mind of the average
engine builder with regard to cause and effect, the result being that much effort
is sometimes misdirected while trying to deal with the vibration-induced failures.
The purpose of this page is to try to give a brief overview of the two types of
vibration and their effects - details on how to deal with them are in separate
pages.
The first one we'll look at is torsional vibration. This is where one end of
the crank twists to and fro relative to the other end. Symptoms of excessive torsional
vibration include:
Flywheel or flexplate bolts loosening
Harmonic balancer rims walking
Spark scatter
Crankshaft cracks
Torsional vibration is covered in more detail in a later section but the important
thing to remember now is that TV and its effects are mostly unrelated to the balance
of the rotating assembly. A question that often comes up on web forums (and if there's a worse
place to get good information I haven't found it yet)
is "How can I stop my flywheel bolts from loosening?" Someone invariably suggests getting
the engine balanced -
these types of problem are
unrelated to engine balance
.
The second set of vibration related symptoms are caused by one of a number of crank
imbalance issues. These are usually caused by the positioning and proportioning of the
crankshaft counterweights. Bear in mind that if you are "balancing" (note the quotes) a Holden
six crank using conventional methods and equipment you'll be led to believe the rotating
assembly is properly balanced when it almost certainly doesn't even approach that condition. Symptoms include:
Block cracking or splitting longitudinally
Spitting out welch plugs
Cracks or breakage of main caps or webs
These problems are totally unrelated to the torsional vibration issues mentioned earlier.
One more thing we might mention in closing is the term "harmonics". It's popularly used
to describe nearly any sort of vibration or resonance, but strictly speaking it refers to a multiple
of a vibration frequency. So a part that has a natural frequency of say 500 hertz will often
also resonate at the harmonic frequencies or overtones of 1000, 1500, 2000 hertz as well. Harmonic balancers
in reality have little to do with harmonics but a lot to do with plain old resonance.
Block breakage is often blamed on harmonics (and it's
true that damping the block with grout helps a lot) but in reality it is just the blocks natural
resonant frequency coinciding with the frequency of vibrations emanating from the crankshaft.
Nitpicking maybe, but it tends to cloud an already widely misunderstood subject.
