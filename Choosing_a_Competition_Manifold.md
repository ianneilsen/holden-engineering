Choosing a competition manifold
Whether you go for injection or or carburation, you'll have to
choose between two types of manifolding:
Individual, isolated tuned length runners, using a throttle valve in each runner, or..
Individual tuned length runners connecting the head ports to a common plenum chamber
We'll look at both types in more detail later but the first type is
typically what you'd find on a multi-cylinder motorcycle engine - a separate
runner and carb or throttle body for each cylinder, with each cylinder
being completely independent from the others.
The second type again uses seperate tuned length runners, but this
time they are fed from a common plenum chamber. Examples of this type
of manifold would include the VK EFI or the tunnel-ram manifold typically
used with drag racing V8s. Agricultural designs such as the common single
two or four barrel manifolds are
not
included in this group as
they are neither tuned length or suited for competition use.
So which is the one to use? It depends on what the vehicle will be used
for but in most cases the IR is the best choice for circuit racing while
a plenum ram usually prevails for drag racing applications providing
the rpm can be held in a fairly narrow range.
There's not a lot of difference in peak output between the two types - 10 or
15 hp perhaps. But the IR will make usable power from a much lower speed
than the plenum-ram type, and this flexibility easily outweighs the small
top-end disadvantage with most forms of racing. On the other hand though,
if you race a lightweight dragster or altered with a very high stall speed
converter and a 3 speed transmission you could probably make good use
of the plenum rams small but significant peak power advantage. There are some
reasonably good IR manifolds available for use with Weber carbs or injection
throttle bodies, but if you want to race with some sort of plenum-ram manifold
then you're going to have to make it yourself.
