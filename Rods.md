How To Build A High-Performance Holden Six

Rods
For a mild street engine, particularly a 3" stroke that won't be
revved much past 5000rpm the stock red motor rods should be fine.
In an engine that won't see much more than say 6500 - 7000rpm use
the heavy duty rods from either the 4 cyl Starfire engine or the
later blue/black engines - they are the same rod and use a slightly
larger bolt than the red rods - 11/32" versus 5/16". However if
you're going to be turning 7000 - 7500rpm plus then it would be
wise to use something stronger. In the past it was fairly common to
use rods from other makers, eg. rods from Mini, BMW, VW Passat and
Toyota engines have all been used, but considering the reasonable
price of some of the aftermarket rods it would probably be better
to take this route instead. Aluminium rods would normally be a good
choice for an engine like the little six, for their light weight as
well as their shock-dampening capacity, but the close proximity of
the camshaft to the crank makes fitting the bulky aluminium rods
difficult.
Always replace the rod bolts when stripping and reassembling the
engine, the aftermarket ARP bolts are the usual choice.
Rod ratios
Changing the rod ratio became popular 30 odd years ago, mainly by
substituting a longer than stock rod. The common wisdom was that
for high performance use a long rod was beneficial, and "ideal"
rod ratios of 1.8:1 or 2:1 for example were promoted by various
engine builders. A lot of engines have been built and a lot of research done
since then, and it now seems the ideal rod ratio isn't such a cut
and dried number. Rather, it seems that a suitable rod ratio is
one that is compatible with several other characteristics of the engine.
Traditionally it was thought that a shortish rod was totally wrong
for anything other than a very low revving engine - however if you
look at what's been used successfully on other engines (such as many Hondas)
you'll find short rods making power to 10,000rpm and beyond. The key
is parts compatibility, just like any other parts selection process.
Briefly then, these are the factors to consider when choosing a rod
ratio:
The rev range - a low rev range (say under 4 - 5000rpm) favours
a very short rod. It gives better burning through increased mixture motion
and a better mechanical advantage in the initial parts of the power stroke.
Rod ratios of 1.5 - 1.6:1 are common.
Conversely, at very high rpms a very long rod ratio is beneficial. Formula 1
engines that run to around 20,000rpms run a very long rod that slows the piston
motion away from TDC and allows the expanding gases to maintain pressure on the
piston. Ratios up to 3:1 may be used here. In applications not so extreme as these
two examples ratios of 1.65 to 1.8:1 are most common.
A short rod can help balance a big, lazy intake port (eg. 4V Clevo). The
quicker piston motion towards and away from TDC provides a stronger intake
signal. Of course, if the engine is intake restricted the short rod will make
it worse.
A long rod helps balance a slightly undersized intake port by giving more
uniform piston speed during the intake stroke. Long rods first became popular
with the smallblock Chevy, where they helped to counteract the somewhat restrictive
intake ports of the 23 degree heads that were then all that was available.
The piston dwells slightly longer at BDC with a short rod, and this allows
us to use a cam LSA a degree or two wider than with a long rod, and without losing
low end torque.
A short rod has a higher level of side thrust on the cylinder wall. This is
generally inconsequential with lower outputs and/or sturdily built engines, but for
engines with cylinder walls having marginal stiffness (186's and 202's for example)
it may overide any other factors. Even the short-rod Hondas commonly have wall-support
studs fitted through the outer block walls when modified for more power.
So how does all this apply to our little sixes? Seeing as the most commonly hot-rodded
versions (186 and 202ci) are severely intake restricted and have bores that are
rather fragile, it would appear that a longer rod would be advantageous. And in fact
with either of these engines I'd use the longest possible rod consistent with good
piston design.
Aftermarket rods give us the option of using a much longer rod:stroke
ratio but before you go ordering special rods
there are some practical considerations to think about. Firstly the
increase in rod length has to be quite large to have any
appreciable effect - it's unlikely that a rod of only 5mm or so
extra length would make measurably more power, though another 15 -
20mm or so would help. But this leads us to another
problem, the piston. Obviously a longer rod will require a piston
with a higher pin position, but there are limits to how far this
can be taken. The side load from the rod angularity is transmitted
to the cylinder wall via the gudgeon pin and piston skirt, and
ideally the pin would be positioned exactly half-way up the skirt
to maintain durability and minimise drag and piston rock. Moving
the pin centreline towards the piston crown puts side loads on the
ring pack, a part of the piston poorly suited for this duty. Piston
rock at TDC will increase while ring seal and durability will
decrease.
What I'm getting at is this: substantially longer rods will
improve performance, but only if a reasonable pin position can be
maintained. Obviously though the shorter thrust surface is somewhat balanced
out by the lesser thrust from the long rod. The deck height of the Holden
block allows for using rods of not much more than 6" long with a 3-1/4" crank and reasonably
proportioned pistons. But if using extra-long rods also meant using
ugly pistons I'd just stick with a more moderate length.
This pin position issue (along with an excessively short rod ratio)
also arises with stroker engines, and again it would pay to do whatever
was necessary to keep the pin as close to the middle of the skirt
as possible, perhaps by slightly crowding the ring pack towards the
crown. In extreme cases a special piston could be made with a
single compression ring positioned as high as possible, and with
the oil ring below the pin.
Stock rods - including Starfires - use a pressed in gudgeon pin.
This seems to work well even with fairly big increases in speeds and
horsepower, but in an all-out engine floating pins will be less likely
to gall the pin bores of the piston. Not only that, but in a competition engine
that is regularly stripped and rebuilt the floating pins are much easier to 
live with. By using DLC coated pins it's possible
to simply hone the pin bore for clearance, drill an oil hole or two and run on the steel rod material.
With plain pins though, or any application that reduces the available oil (eg. vacuum
pumps or dry sumps with very low crankcase pressures) I'd use bronze bushes.
Starfire rods have had the little
end bored for bronze bushes successfully in the past, but the wall thickness will
be very thin after this operation and I'd be a bit nervous about doing
it. Quality control isn't all that flash with the Holden rods and some
of the pin bores end up being quite a bit off centre. If you must
bush Starfire rods try to find rods that have a uniform amount of material
around the little-end eye.

is centred in the Holden rod.
