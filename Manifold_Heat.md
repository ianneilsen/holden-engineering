How To Build A High-Performance Holden Six

Manifold Heat
The original manifolds generally had some form of heating; either from
the exhaust gas or engine coolant. It's pretty standard practice to
isolate the heat source with any performance manifold, and to run the
manifold as cool as possible in the interests of maintaining the highest
possible charge density. For those running downdraft carbs however,
there may in fact be some advantage to supplying a controlled amount of
heat to the manifold. Unlike a V8 manifold which has a large surface area
with which to absorb heat from the engine (even without the exhaust crossover)
straight six manifolds are mostly out in the breeze and tend to run very cool.
A bit of heat applied to the manifold floor can improve the mixture quality
dramatically, and the resulting improvement in performance can more than make
up for any small drop in charge density.
Most downdraft carbs tend to produce large droplets or strings of fuel when
compared to say an SU or Dell'Orto, and a fair bit of this fuel will tend to drop
out of suspension. To make matters worse the manifold will almost certainly
have some long runners with significant bends. The end result is that at
small throttle openings hesitations and stumbles are common, and/or extra
fuel has to be supplied to compensate for the unmixed fuel. It's not a problem
at bigger throttle openings where there is sufficient air volume and velocity
to carry and mix the fuel, but for applications where clean running off a closed
throttle (eg. out of corners on a circuit car) is important then experimentation
with manifold heat could certainly pay off. Wet fuel flow and pooling will be
much reduced and the car will likely feel sharper and run more cleanly.
Engine coolant is the best source of heat, being a fairly constant temperature.
Exhaust heat on the other hand tends to leave the manifold too cool at light throttle when
you really want it hot, while at full throttle when you want the manifold
to be cool it will be much too hot and reduce the engines output. If the coolant flow is controlled
(eg. by an orifice) enough heat will flow to maintain light throttle mixture
quality without reducing full throttle power. At wide open throttle, the sheer
volume and velocity of air flow will be enough to prevent any significant heating
of the charge. Welding a length of aluminium half-pipe to the underside of the
manifold provides a coolant flow passage that has the coolant in direct contact
with the manifold floor and is easily done. I realise this goes against popular
performance practice, but for any street application as well as many competition cars
a bit of manifold heat will very likely improve the in-car performance with
downdraft induction.
