Assembly and Running In
There's nothing out of the ordinary to consider as far as
assembly goes but even so we'll briefly touch on a couple of
points. The first is the use of engine build sheets. Basically
these are just a record of every dimension and clearance in the
engine. For example for every cylinder you would note the bore and
piston diameters and the resulting clearance, and the ring gap for
each ring. At the bottom end you would record the main tunnel
diameters as well as the journal and bearing diameters, bearing
clearances, rod and crank end float etc. Things like deck heights,
chamber volumes and spring heights should also be noted; anything
at all really that is normally measured and quantified during a
build. It doesn't have to be anything flash; handwritten notes in
an old exercise book are fine. There are a couple of reasons for
doing this. One is that it can help prevent things being
overlooked, something that can happen to anyone no matter how many
engines you have built. The second is that it is sometimes handy to
have a record of what parts (including over and undersizes) are in
an engine for future work. It's also not a bad idea to mark each
fastener with a paint marker pen after it has been fully torqued
up. It might seem a childishly simple thing but even experienced
engine builders have been known to overlook a critical bolt and the
paint mark is cheap insurance against this.
While we're on fasteners, we might take a quick look at the use
of aftermarket studs to replace the factory bolts that retain the main
caps and cylinder head. Using studs can provide two advantages over
bolts: a higher clamping force is possible because of the use of fine
threads on the nut end of the stud, and secondly, for an engine that
is frequently stripped and reassembled it reduces the risk of pulling
the threads from the block. For any reasonable n/a street engine the
factory bolts will be perfectly adequate, even at quite high outputs.
For racing engines though, especially those that are boosted, the head
studs in particular are worthwhile even if only for the fact that the
studs can be retensioned without tending to pull the top thread or two
from the deck, and without creating water leaks. The part number for the
stud kits are:
Mains Studs - ARP 132-5401 or ProComp PC2433
Head Studs - ARP 152-4001 or ProComp PC2461
It might seem odd to some of you that I'd list some of those part
numbers - and there is certainly the ethical question over supporting
a manufacturer that shamelessly steals others design work. But if the
budget is very tight these cheap stud kits will do the job just fine at a fraction
of the cost of the US made items.
I should also mention the use of special assembly lubes, and why
you should avoid them like the plague. If the components are oiled
with a good mineral oil during assembly, and the oiling system is
primed before startup, then there will be no lubrication problems
and no need for special assembly lubes at all. Why do we need to
avoid them? A good ring seal is absolutely critical to getting the
most from an engine, and any special "superlube" used during
assembly will mix with the oil and potentially be very detrimental
to getting the rings bedded in effectively. Moly grease on cam
lobes is probably the worst offender. This stuff is often supplied
with the cam, and some guys slop it on like a redhead slops on
sunscreen. It does provide very good protection for the cam if
oiling is inadequate, but it also washes off quickly and will end
up embedded in the cylinder walls. Most cam grinders won't give any
warranty if you don't use it, but they're more concerned with
avoiding claims than with your ring seal (and fair enough too).
It's really just to provide some lubrication until the oil starts
to splash around, so if you're confident you will immediately have
oil pressure you can safely leave the moly grease off. Of course
this assumes you'll be using a good zinc rich oil. I generally just
use a thin smear of conventional wheel bearing type grease
(non-moly) to prevent dry running for those first few revs until
the oil is being thrown around and have few cam or lifter
problems. Of course if you will be running high spring pressures
you will need to run light springs or leave out the inners until
the cam has been run in, regardless of whether or not you use the
moly grease.
In the page on cooling systems we mentioned the importance of
using a thermostat with a bleed hole. I bring this up again here
because the lack of a bleed hole is sometimes a very big problem
with a newly built engine. What occasionally happens is the proud owner
or builder of the said engine quickly fills the radiator to the brim and then
fires it up to run the cam in. Unfortunately for him the head and
top part of the block are still bone dry because there is no way for
the air to escape, thus allowing the water to fill the head.
Because the thermostat is sitting in thin air it often remains closed
until the engine is well cooked, and likewise the temperature gauge
sender reports all as being well. Often the cooked engine is blamed
on a faulty thermostat, when the real cause of course was a simple air lock.
I've seen this happen more than once and in one case it cracked some
expensive heads. At any rate it's something to be aware of.
Prior to the initial startup you should already have your
ignition set up and timed so you don't have to stuff around with
timing during the break-in process. Fill the engine with good
mineral oil - definitely
do not
use synthetic. Run-in oil
is unnecessary; just use a good oil with sufficient zinc to allow the
cam to survive. Then fill with water, bleed out any air and check for leaks. Don't use coolant or
anti-freeze just yet; you can add this later once you have
confirmed everything is watertight. It's not possible to prime the
oil pump with a drill like you would with a Chevy; it has to be
cranked over. Leave the plugs out and the rockers off until you
have oil pressure; if the pump is in good shape and it was oiled
during assembly it will pick up the oil almost immediately. Once
you have pressure keep cranking for a while to get all the air
purged from the oilways. You can now fit the rockers, rocker cover
and spark plugs and fire it up.
The first twenty minutes are absolutely critical for both cam
life and ring seal. It's pretty common for people to run in the cam
by running the engine unloaded for 20 minutes at 2000rpm before bedding
in the rings. This is OK but you're more likely to get the optimum ring seal
if you can get the engine heavily loaded right from the start. In other words
run the cam and rings in simultaneously. I generally run the engine
at 2000rpm just long enough to check for leaks - 30 seconds is plenty - then take it out on the
road and stand on it. You
must
get the revs up to about
2000 straight away in order to get some oil on the cam and to ensure the lifters
are rotating. You also
need to get some seriously heavy loading on the engine to bed in the
rings. Don't let it idle; if there is a problem shut it off and fix
it before restarting. The run-in period is the worst
possible time to be setting up a new and untuned carburetor or ECU;
if possible use a known good carb setup that will allow you to
drive the engine under load immediately. You can always fit and
tune the new setup later. My personal preference is for something
like a 350 Holley for the run in. The reason for this is that even
with a previously untested combination it's usually possible to estimate
a main jet size with the little Holley that turns out to be pretty close to the
optimum, certainly close enough to run the engine in. Likewise make sure the ignition is ready
to go before startup. A dyno is the best way to control the load,
but if you can get on the road and load it fairly heavily that's
okay too. Basically you want to accelerate the vehicle with at
least 3/4 throttle for a few seconds at a time before closing the
throttle and letting the car slow down before repeating the
procedure. Use 2nd or 3rd gear at first, then later you can use
higher gears and hold the load for longer. If in any doubt about how hard
to drive it just stand on it - a properly built engine
will tolerate full throttle and load right from the start without
problems, though you may have to limit the revs somewhat if you are running
light springs. Just listen carefully for any signs of detonation. After about twenty minutes of this you should have a
very
good ring seal and no further special treatment will be required
though it certainly wouldn't hurt to give it another hour or so of
limited revs before fitting the inners where this applies. Avoid
idling even after the run-in procedure; it's hard on the cam at any
stage of the engines life. It's not a bad idea to change the oil
and filter after the run-in; also check the valve clearances again
as a check on the health of the cam lobes and fit the inner springs
if necessary.
