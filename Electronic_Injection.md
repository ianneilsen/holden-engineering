How To Build A High-Performance Holden Six

The only complete off-the-shelf EFI setups for the Holden six
that's suitable for competition use
that I'm aware of is the one made by Sonic Injection (see links section).
For accurate metering over a wide range of speeds and
conditions, a well tuned EFI system will be unbeatable - but note
the use of the words "well-tuned". A poorly tuned EFI will be just
as bad as any poorly tuned system.
Because the injectors regulate the amount of fuel injected by
varying the amount of time they are open (rather than by varying
supply pressure) it's possible to get a good spray pattern and
mixture quality even at very low speeds and at idle. Injector pulse
width is determined by the ECU, which calculates the value using
inputs that may include mass air flow, manifold pressure, throttle
position, crankshaft speed, coolant temperature etc. Systems for
competition use are often simplified to use only crank speed,
throttle position and/or manifold pressure.
Building and tuning a good EFI system will cost a bit more than
say triple Webers and it does add some complexity, but because EFI
is so ubiquitous on modern cars EFI expertise is probably now more
widespread than that for carbs. Interestingly a carburettor will
often show as much power on a dyno as injection, but on the strip a
properly tuned EFI will be markedly quicker. In summary, a well
done EFI system will provide the best performance in nearly any
application.
