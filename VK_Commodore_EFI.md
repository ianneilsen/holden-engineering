VK Commodore EFI Systems
The EFI from the VK can perform very well, despite being very
simple - almost to the point of being crude. The system has few
inputs, and has no feedback devices such as oxygen sensors etc. The
injectors are wired in two groups of three, but all fire
simultaneously at 120deg intervals. The manifold design provides
very good midrange torque and is suitable for engine speeds up to
about 5500rpm - ideal for a strong street car. A bit of judicious
portwork at the transition area leading up to the gasket face
should pay off with even more flow and power. The relative crudity
of the fuel control makes the fuel economy from these units less
than spectacular and in fact better economy can be had from the
Varajet equipped engines. Improvements to the controls make these
units perform even better, with gains in both power and economy.
There are limitations with the stock ECU with regard to
compatability with longer duration cams. Aftermarket, tunable ECUs
are readily available though, as are bigger injectors and throttle
bodies etc. A popular budget mod is fitting the 808 Delco ECU from
the JE Camira. These are cheap, programmable (using something like
Kalmaker) and able to use additional inputs such as exhaust oxygen
sensors. I won't go into much detail here on EFI's but there are
plenty of people out there who have used these successfully, and
there are some good how-to's on the web.
The strong point of the EFI system is the midrange torque
provided by the long manifold runners, and this manifold also works
very well with LPG. For an LPG-only engine the compression ratio
can be raised to make up for the slight drop in output that LPG
normally brings. There won't be any distribution or fuel drop-out
problems and you'll get a nice flat torque curve...
Be aware that the EFI manifold becomes quite restrictive at
higher revs and flow rates - say around 5500rpm/180hp and up. There
is a substantial reduction in area for a distance of about 100mm
back from the gasket face, and there isn't enough wall thickness to
open them up without first building them up with weld. And even if
you did open them up it's likely that the runners would be too long
for high rpm work anyway. For practical 12 port street car projects
though, a VK EFI may well be the best choice.

as they approach the head.
