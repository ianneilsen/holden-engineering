the clearance/viscosity/temperature equation
One of the more debated engine related topics would be the choice of
oil and bearing clearances. Some prefer a thin synthetic oil with tight
clearances, while others go for a very heavy old-school oil with very loose
clearances. Which is best? Unfortunately there's no universally applicable approach
for every engine and every form of competition, but if you do a little planning
you can help ensure that you make the most possible power without
driving over your own crankshaft. If you're thinking this is all a bit over the
top for a mild street engine you're right - for that application just use around
.002" to .0025" clearance and an oil no thicker than a 15W-40.
There are three major factors that all influence each other: oil viscosity,
bearing clearance and oil temperature. None of these factors can be
considered in isolation; when you choose one you must choose all three.
There are other factors - journal speed for one - that are also influential
but for our purposes here they can be ignored.
Let's look at oil temperature first. Depending on how the vehicle is used
it could be anywhere from around 40 or 50 degrees C to 120c or higher. What
you need to work on is the highest oil temp that will be encountered while
the engine is operated at full throttle. Let's look at a drag racer first.
Generally speaking you'd want to run the engine quite cold in order to maximise
performance. If the car is started (cold) behind the line and does a brief burnout
then the oil temp is probably only going to reach 40 or 50 degrees throughout
the run. A sedan that is driven to the line will obviously run a bit warmer but
still it will be possible to keep it fairly cool - 70 odd degrees perhaps - if
it isn't allowed to idle in the queue too much. And if you are likely to make several
runs with only short breaks in between then this needs to be taken into account too.
A circuit racer or street car
will be at the other end of the heat scale. Typically it may be around 110 degrees
or so. But whatever the type of racing it's important to be careful about running
the engine outside its intended temperature range. For example if a dragster engine
was built to be raced at say 50 deg. you'd have to avoid letting the oil temperature
getting too much higher than that. Or with a circuit car you'd need to make sure
the engine was treated gently until the oil temp. was brought up to somewhere near
it's running level. Obviously synthetic oil will have a significant advantage with
both scenarios because of it's relatively stable viscosity over a range of temperatures.
OK, let's assume we now have a fairly good idea of the oil temperature we will be
racing (or at least driving) at. We now have to choose an oil and bearing clearance
pairing. If you check the specifications of the various oils available (try the websites) you'll find
the manufacturers will give a viscosity (generally in centistokes) listed at a couple
of different temperatures, typically 40 and 100 degrees. What you need to do is choose
an oil that is at a usable viscosity at the temperature it will be run at. Normally
you'd be looking for something that will be in the range of around 10 to 20 centistokes,
though you'll soon find that it's almost impossible to find a sufficiently thin oil for a
cool-running dragster engine. Oils at the lighter end of that range will normally produce more power,
not just because of the reduced friction but also because they have less tendency to "rope"
around the crankshaft. There is at least one exception to this thinner-is-better rule though,
and we'll cover that later. Here's a table showing some typical viscosities at 40 and 100C.
Note how the SAE viscosity numbers are basically meaningless, and how ridiculously thick some
of the mineral oils are at low temperatures.

This table is only for illustrative purposes -
don't
use it to select a particular grade of oil!
One companies 5W-30 is likely to be completely different to anothers - the SAE numbers are useless for all practical purposes.
You
must
use your particular oil makers data sheets to determine the viscosity at
your running temperature.
We're now at the point that we know the racing oil temperature and the viscosity of
the chosen oil at this temperature. All thats left is to set the bearing clearances
to suit. The optimum clearance is very roughly in proportion to the viscosity, so for
a light oil that is around 10 to 15cSt at running temperature we would need bearing clearances
of only .0018" to .002". Heavier oils need a correspondingly wider clearance.
As mentioned before there is a power advantage to running at
the lighter and tighter end of the range. There is however at least one application where
it may pay to forfeit this extra power, and that's with extremely highly loaded engines
that run at moderate rpms with the possibility of some detonation and fuel dilution.
Blown gas or alcohol drag engines in other words. These engines should be built to run very heavy
oils and wide bearing clearances - 50cSt or more viscosity and up to .0045" or .005" of
bearing clearance. This combination provides a bit of a buffer against dilution thinning as
well as a little cushioning. For everyone else though the other end of the scale is where
the power is.
Here is a table showing suggested clearances for various viscosities at racing temps.
I should mention again that if you are going to be running at either the top or bottom
of the range (ie. quite tight or quite loose) then you need to be wary of running the oil
far outside of its intended heat range.
