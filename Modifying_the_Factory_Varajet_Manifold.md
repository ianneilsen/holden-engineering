Modifying the Factory Varajet Manifold
The factory manifold design for 12 port carbureted engines
was quite a departure from previous factory and aftermarket manifolds.
The factory 12 port manifold is a relatively sophisticated design, at least
when compared to older manifolds. It was set up to use a staged 2 barrel carb and
has runner dividers to encourage some amount of inertia assistance. In stock form
it's fairly restrictive but can work reasonably well with a Weber carb and make
up to 180 horsepower. Unmodified they work quite poorly with a Holley, and
part throttle fuel distribution in particular is quite uneven. With a small amount
of work though, they can be improved significantly and made to work very well with
a 500cfm Holley. This combination can produce over 200hp while maintaining a stock
appearance.
Manifold modified.
This shot shows how the carb is oriented to maintain the best
mixture distribution
The actual modifications are quite simple. First the original carb mounting pad
is milled completely off, flush with the top of the runners. The EGR mount is also
completely removed. Next, a one inch thick open aluminium two-barrel spacer is welded
on. This is positioned so that the throttle spindle is parallel to the engine axis and
the centreline of the opening is in line with the centreline of the outer runners.
The area on the side (where the EGR was) is cut back and plated over so that the
inner wall of the plate is 5 - 10mm out from the opening in the spacer. Once all this
is in place the new carb mount can be blended into the manifold roof with generous radii.
If desired an additional aluminium or phenolic open spacer can be used for added plenum
volume as well as providing clearance for the throttle arm.
Much of the flow improvement comes from cleaning up the casting - in standard form
it's pretty ugly. There are various steps and lumps in the floor and some of these are
more easily cleaned up before the carb mount is welded on. There is a big step on the floor
of the centre two runners about 90 odd mm in from the head flange. You'll need a long shanked
carbide ball to reach these but they have to go. The last 50mm or so of each runner is poorly
shaped and needs to be blended and enlarged to match the head ports.
How much does all this help? I've seen improvements of nearly 40cfm even with fairly ordinary
porting; the flow ends up being a little more than that of a standard EFI manifold. Of course
the carb manifold won't have the strong inertia tuning of the fuellie, but with a carb of at least 500cfm
(at 3" hg) 200hp or a little more is possible, and the engine still looks fairly stock.
